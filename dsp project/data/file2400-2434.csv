Indeed, when one sibling is asked to compare themselves to others in their family, birth order shows weak-to-moderate effects on personality (e.g., Healey and Ellis, 2007, Paulhus et al., 1999). No study to date, however, has utilized a complete within-family design that includes independent self-reports from both firstborn and laterborn siblings in the same family. To fill this gap, we collected Big Five personality data on 69 young adult firstborn–laterborn sibling pairs. We also obtained data from parents of the sibling pairs and peer ratings of original participants’ personality traits. Within-family analyses revealed that neither siblings’ independent self-reported personality traits, nor parents’ reports of their children’s personality traits, differed systematically as a function of birth order. Our findings are consistent with …</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|April Bleske-Rechek and Jenna A Kelley|Year|2014|Publisher|Pergamon|Citedby|40|Eprint|https://bleske-rechek.com/April%20Website%20Files/Bleske-Rechek%20and%20Kelley%202013.%20Birth%20order%20and%20personality.pdf', '|Title|General and domain-specific beliefs about intelligence, ability, and effort among preservice and practicing teachers|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">This study examined preservice and practicing teachers’ beliefs about factors influencing student academic performance. Participants viewed teacher factors as a more important determinant of academic performance than student or family factors. However, teachers who held a stronger entity view of students’ intelligence viewed teachers as less responsible for students’ academic performance. Teachers held the most ability-based views of performance in the arts and the most effort-based views of performance in the humanities. General beliefs about intelligence were related to domain-specific beliefs in the areas of basic skills, humanities, and math and science, but not in the arts or physical domains.</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|Meagan M Patterson and Natasha Kravchenko and Li Chen-Bouck and Jenna A Kelley|Year|2016|Publisher|Pergamon|Citedby|10|Eprint|https://epsy.ku.edu/sites/epsy.ku.edu/files/docs/people/vita/M_Patterson-09-22-2016.pdf', '|Title|Racial socialization in White American families: An exploration of the roles of parental racial identity, parental racial attitudes, and racial socialization messages|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">This paper explores the relationship among White parents’ racial attitudes, racial identity development, and racial socialization strategies. Parents were asked to use both quantitative measures and qualitative vignettes to report how they would talk to their pre-adolescent child about race. In line with previous research (Hughes et al., 2006), parents predominantly adopted an egalitarian socialization strategy, suggesting that everyone should be treated the same, regardless of race. Although White parents indicated they found both present and future discussions of race important, when given the opportunity with qualitative vignettes, many parents did not include race or racial issues in their responses. This indicates a pattern of colorblind or colormute socialization that has been reflected in White racial socialization literature; the idea that race should not matter and should not be discussed with children. Egalitarian socialization was linked to White racial identity statuses, but not related to racial bias or school diversity estimates.</div></div>|Author|Jenna Anne Kelley|Year|2016|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/22020/Kelley_ku_0099M_14856_DATA_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', '|Title|Racial socialization practices among White American parents: Relations to racial attitudes, racial identity, and school diversity|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This study examines racial socialization practices among White American parents (<i>N</i> = 154) of children aged 8 to 12 years, using both quantitative and qualitative measures, as well as the relations of racial attitudes, racial identity, and racial diversity of the schools that children attend to socialization practices. Responses on the qualitative socialization measure indicate that White parents are generally unlikely to discuss race or racism with their children in a direct, explicit fashion, even when the parents are responding to a situation in which racial bias is clear and salient. Parents with less biased racial attitudes were more likely to engage in color-conscious racial socialization and to present socialization messages that emphasized egalitarianism and the existence of racial discrimination.

Although between family designs have consistently failed to find effects of birth order, a modified within-family design has documented predicted effects. That is, when one sibling compares him/herself to their siblings, birth order predicts who is nominated as the most conscientious and who is most open or rebellious (unconventional). However, directly comparing oneself to one\'s sibling encourages contrast effects. The purpose of this study was to employ a true within-family design that uses independent self-report data from both a firstborn and laterborn adult sibling from each family (in addition to parent reports of both siblings). In accord with Judith Rice Harris\' theory of personality development, it was expected that neither adult siblings\' independent self-reported personality traits nor parents\' reports of those siblings\' personality traits would differ by birth order.</div></div>|Author|Jenna A Kelley|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/66786/KelleySpr2013.pdf?sequence=1', '|Title|Does Rearing Environment Shape Romantic Attachment Style? Using Siblings to Test for Shared Environmental Influences|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Attachment research began when John Bowlby recognized the importance of the bonds, or ""attachments,"" formed between infants and their caregivers. In the late 1980s, psychologists extended Bowlby\'s research into the domain of adult romantic love by proposing that romantic love can be conceptualized as a process of becoming attached (e.g., Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987). Since Hazan and Shaver\'s (1987) initial conceptualization of romantic love as an attachment process, researchers have documented links between attachment dimensions and memories of one\'s relationships with parents during childhood, parental relationship status (e.g., divorced), and one\'s own current and past romantic relationship experiences. Research has not, however, determined the causes of individual differences in romantic attachment style. A series of studies were conducted to explore the possibility that romantic attachment style is transmitted via the family, either through shared genes or shared rearing environment.</div></div>|Author|Amy E Johnson and Bethany R Franklin and Jenna A Kelley|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/63033/Johnson3Spr2012.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', '|Title|Birth Order and Personality: Testing Assumptions with Independent Siblings\' Reports|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Assumptions about the effects of birth order on personality abound in popular culture, self-help books, and the scholarly literature. Judith Rich Harris has proposed that, if birth order does affect individuals\' behavior, it does so only within the family context. According to Harris, tactics that may be effective at home for a child of a given birth order are not necessarily going to be effective for that child in other contexts. There is no known study that has directly tested Harris\' theory by assessing two adult siblings who were raised in the same home, and comparing their personalities as a function of their birth order. This study was designed with that specific objective, with the prediction (in accord with Harris\' theory) that adult siblings\' independent self-reports would not differ as a function of birth order.</div></div>|Author|Bethany R Franklin and Amy E Johnson and Jenna A Kelley|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/64540/FranklinSpr2012.pdf?sequence=1']"

The contrast in the images produced is related to changes in the X-ray refractive index of the tissues, resulting in remarkable clarity compared with conventional X-ray images based on absorption effects. These changes were greatest at the boundaries between different tissues, giving a marked edge enhancement effect and three-dimensional appearance to the images.

This process leads to fetal anemia, and in severe cases can progress to edema, ascites, heart failure, and death. Infants affected with HDFN can have hyperbilirubinemia in the acute phase and hyporegenerative anemia for weeks to months after birth. The diagnosis and management of pregnant women with HDFN is based on laboratory and radiographic monitoring. Fetuses with marked anemia may require intervention with intrauterine transfusion. HDFN due to RhD can be prevented by RhIg administration.

Desta forma, buscou-se estudar os Processos Oxidativos Avançados (POAs), mais especificamente a fotocatálise heterogênea, que baseada na radiação (UV) sobre um catalisador, gera radicais hidroxila (HO•) altamente reativos, capaz de mineralizar uma variedade de compostos orgânicos formando compostos inócuos. Para estudar a cinética de degradação e avaliar a influência da concentração inicial de 2, 4, 6-triclorofenol e de 2, 4, 6-tribromofenol, a concentração do catalisador e o pH, elaborou-se uma matriz experimental, resultando em dezesseis ensaios.

By using ethnographic techniques to study the day-to-day practices of strategy making in one firm, I examine the ways actors attempted to transform their own cognitive frames of a situation into predominant frames through a series of interactions. Frames are the means by which managers make sense of ambiguous information from their environments. Actors each had cognitive frames about the direction the market was taking and about what kinds of solutions would be appropriate. Where frames about a strategic choice were not congruent, actors engaged in highly political framing practices to make their frames resonate and to mobilize action in their favor. Those actors who most skillfully engaged in these practices shaped the frame that prevailed in the organization.

This qualitative analysis sheds light on questions that have perennially plagued executives and intrigued scholars: How do organizations change routines in order to overcome inertia in the face of radical change in the environment? And, specifically, what is the role of the CEO in this process? Inertial behavior in such circumstances has been attributed to ingrained routines that are based on cognitive and motivational truces. Routines are performed because organizational participants find them to cohere to a particular cognitive frame about what should be done (the cognitive dimension) and to resolve conflicts about what gets rewarded or sanctioned (the motivational dimension).

Despite a wealth of literature on mixing qualitative and quantitative methods (Bryman, 2006; Creswell &amp; Clark, 2007; Jick, 1979; Small, 2011), rarely do individual scholars conduct both forms of research, and even more rarely do they present them together in a single scholarly work. Quantitative researchers may view qualitative research as suspect, or only as a means to generate hypotheses to test in quantitative analyses. According to this view, qualitative research is but an intermediate output supporting “empirical” regression analysis. On the other hand however, qualitative researchers often view quantitative work as too reductive. They may only include quantitative data for rhetorical purposes, recognizing that they are outnumbered (no pun intended) in a world dominated by scholars untrained in qualitative methods.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">There are many understandings of the words qualitative and quantitative within various research traditions.

Company cases are essentially stories, and stories are ways of conveying understanding, creating meaning, and justifying action. We can still use these company narratives as part of a process of reflection and dialogue.

Using commonly available technologies, microwave traps can be built with large depth (up to several Kelvin) and acceptance volume (up to several cm<sup>3</sup>), suitable for efficient loading with currently available sources of cold polar molecules. Unlike most previous traps for molecules, this technology can be used to confine the strong-field seeking absolute ground state of the molecule, in a free-space maximum of the microwave electric field. Such ground state molecules should be immune to inelastic collisional losses.

By observing time-resolved quantum beats between these sublevels, we look for interference between the Stark-induced mixing and the much smaller PNC mixing.
