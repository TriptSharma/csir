We examine many ancient terraces and berms excavated in the Three Rivers region of Belize, synthesize the geography and suggest the intent of terracing across the Maya Lowlands, and analyze the history of terracing and soil erosion. Terraces occur in several slope positions and diverted and slowed runoff, to build up planting surfaces that could maximize soil moisture. The first accelerated soil erosion occurred during the Preclassic period (1500 <span class=""gs_fscp"">b.c.</span>‐<span class=""gs_fscp"">a.d.</span> 250). Maya terracing started in the Early Classic period (<span class=""gs_fscp"">a.d.</span> 250–600) and spread across the Lowlands with the great population expansion of the Late/Terminal Classic period (<span class=""gs_fscp"">a.d.</span> 600–900).

One argues for the presence of strongly centralized decision-making structures associated with control over aspects of the economy, including arable land and water (eg, Brumfiel and Earle 1987a; Earle 1997; Mann 1986). A second approach, advocated by some cultural ecologists (eg, Netting 1968, 1993) and economic anthropologists (eg, Chayanov 1986; Sahlins 1972), has offered models highlighting the decision-making capacity of individual households, or"" farmsteads."" While both approaches have much to recommend them, and though they may seem antithetical, they in fact view the control and management of natural resources through opposite ends of the same spyglass. Both views argue for a strictly vertical organization of the decision-making process. The former privileges a central political authority atop a hierarchically arranged power structure. The latter, however, favors individual farming households whose surplus production is distributed throughout the rest of a community, often through elite-sponsored or controlled mechanisms such as markets and tribute. We suggest that neither top-down nor bottom-up approaches such as these are adequate for grasping the complexity of ancient political and agricultural landscapes. Ideally, an examination of ancient subsistence and political organization should enable the identification of both the technical skill and knowledge required to farm highly diverse local conditions, and the explication of relationships between a site core …</div></div></div>|Author|Jon B Hageman and Jon C Lohse|Year|2003|Publisher|University of Arizona Press|Citedby|25|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Hageman/publication/259459179_Heterarchy_Corporate_Groups_and_Late_Classic_Resource_Management_in_Northwestern_Belize/links/54ac4f4b0cf2479c2ee7b5cf/Heterarchy-Corporate-Groups-and-Late-Classic-Resource-Management-in-Northwestern-Belize.pdf', '|Title|An integrated assessment of archaeobotanical recovery methods in the Neotropical rainforest of northern Belize: flotation and dry screening|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">This report presents results of a study examining the ancient use of plants at four Late Classic (CE 600-900) Maya rural farmsteads in northwestern Belize.

Rapid regional population growth after 700 B.C. led to increasing land scarcity, which fostered new forms of social organization, including lineages. Archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies convincingly support that centuries of erosion contributed to Late Classic ecological and social milieus, and forced the pressing of ever more marginal lands into agricultural production.

While scholars have addressed this trepidation for writing faculty (see Warnock; Hewett and Ehmann), this hesitancy can be compounded for faculty across the disciplines who seek to transform both content and writing assignments from the physical to the digital classroom. Online course management systems (CMS) can hinder this task because these systems employ teacher-centered rather than participatory models (Palmquist 406). In addition, developing online courses requires that faculty modify their current pedagogy, often while continuing to juggle their face-to-face courses. Even for seasoned faculty, preparing and delivering an online course can be time-consuming, taking three times as long as a F2F course (Palloff and Pratt 74). In “Online Teaching and Classroom Change: The Trans-classroom Teacher in the Age of the Internet,” Susan Lowes calls teachers who are transitioning from F2F to online instruction “trans-classroom teachers,” likening them to immigrants “leav [ing] the familiarity of the face-to-face classroom for the uncharted terrain of the online environment, whose constraints and affordances often lead to very different practices.” The immigrant metaphor is apt, as instructors transitioning to digital culture must adapt to new problems, behaviors, languages, attitudes, and identities.

Instructors often make assumptions that their students\' are familiar with technology, even though students may be hesitant to use technology in the classroom. This dissertation gathers data from one university class and two community college classes to study students\' perceptions of and use of technology, particularly the Blackboard content management system (CMS), in the critical pedagogy classroom. In particular, it studies students\' use of technology to reflect on their own work and engage in dialogue with classmates and the instructor. The evidence suggests that students use technology and media cautiously in the classroom and will revert to more traditional forms of expression (eg, the linear essay) when they feel uncomfortable using technology or they …</div></div></div>|Author|Heidi A Skurat Harris|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|', '|Title|Immersion, Reflection, Failure: Teaching Graduate Students to Teach Writing Online|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A common challenge facing those who prepare graduate students to teach writing online is the need to help those students connect online writing instruction (OWI) theory with their classroom practice.

Much like JoAnn Beard\'s The Boys of My My Youth, the essays hold up pieces of my life for inspection and puts them down again, not always with a sense of resolution. The subtext of the piece revolves around the search to put together the pieces of what my life was before and after my mother, and the transition from girlhood to adulthood with the absence of my mother. I hope also to explore how the self splits after a traumatic death, and the desperate attempt at recreation that takes the place of genuine mourning. The final three pieces are a trilogy exploring my father\'s deteriorating health and my attempts to connect with him while somehow recapturing the self that I lost.</div></div>|Author|Heidi A Skurat Harris|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|']"

Many of these treasures were found in association with tenth-to-twelfth century Chinese export ceramics, and formal similarities with objects from other Southeast Asian cultures affirm regional affinities and inter-island trade networks that flourished in the region before there was regular contact with the Western world. Adornments of elite individuals and the deities they adored include a spectacular array of golden sashes, necklaces, pectorals, diadems, earrings, finger rings, and arm and leg ornaments. The book situates these objects within the context of early Southeast Asian history. In the first chapter, Floriana H. Capistrano-Baker outlines the history of the collection and presents an overview of the objects according to over-lapping categories of form, function, technology, and geographic provenance. In the second chapter, John Miksic explains how the collection contributes to a reassessment of the prehistory of Southeast Asia. Miksic notes the persistence of indigenous forms and the localization of imported traditions, and discusses the correlation between burial practices and social organization and suggests that the removal of gold objects from circulation through ritual burial is an indicator of non-hereditary leadership. Chapter 3, John Guy examines the meaning and metamorphosis of forms in comparison with related material recovered in the region.

Moorehead’s 1891–1892 excavation at the Hopewell Mound Group near Chillicothe, Ohio and housed at the Field Museum. Our five primary goals were to: 1) Enhance access to these legacy collections; 2) Use modern web technologies to integrate and present data to a wide audience; 3) Build from the knowledge-base of senior scholars with intimate knowledge of Ohio Hopewell Collections; 4) Promote research and help educate the public about Ohio Hopewell archaeology; and 5) Help foster the next generation of Hopewell scholars. We completed our 12-month collaboration in December 2015 and the resulting website (hopewell. unl. edu) launched in July of 2016. We hope this collaborative project will advance research by aggregating these data and providing open access to legacy and contemporary archaeological information on the ceremonial activities of the Ohio Hopewell, specifically the creation of mound complexes (eg, Mound City, Hopewell, Seip, Hopeton, Fort Ancient, and Newark).</div></div></div>|Author|Carrie Heitman and William Parkinson and Krystal Britt and Jamie Kelly and Karin Dalziel and Jessica Dussault|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|']"

Should it? What role does diversity play in reducing corporate wrongdoing? Will diversity result in a more focused board of directors or more board autonomy? Examining the state of Tennessee as a case study, the authors collected data on the board composition of publicly traded corporations and compared those data to an original study conducted in 1995. Data indicate only a modest improvement in board diversity. This article discusses reasons for the scarcity of women on boards and concludes that, to enhance strategic decisions, board membership should reflect the corporation\'s consumer population. Thus, women are a critical but overlooked resource.

Based on a survey of owner/operators, results suggest that experienced entrepreneurs, while more opportunity driven and able to leverage resources, placed less emphasis on a proactive orientation. Differences in emphasis on aspects of entrepreneurial marketing were found based on owner/operator motivations and means of business acquisition.

Hence, organizations are more likely to successfully execute either strategy by implementing an HR system that would create the organizational structural characteristics that support the workforce requirements of the chosen strategy.</div></div></div>|Author|Rebecca R Kehoe and Christopher J Collins|Year|2008|Publisher|Emerald Group Publishing Limited|Citedby|17|Eprint|', '|Title|Human resource management and unit performance in knowledge-intensive work.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">To clarify the potential value of a targeted system of human resource (HR) practices, we explore the unique effects of a relationship-oriented HR system and the more commonly studied high commitment HR system on unit performance in the context of knowledge-intensive work. We develop theoretical arguments suggesting that the high commitment HR system contributes to unit performance through its positive effects on employees’ collective organizational commitment, general and firm-specific human capital, and access to knowledge. We argue that the relationship-oriented HR system contributes to unit performance through its positive effects on employees’ collective access to knowledge by fostering a social context and interpersonal exchange conditions which support employees’ ongoing access to knowledge flows within and outside their unit and broader organization.

Aaker defined brand equity as the positive or negative effects that the brand has on consumers\' preferences and purchasing decisions of a product or service marketed under this brand. Brand equity consists of two independent factors. The first dimension of brand equity is brand awareness, which represents the strength of a consumer\'s memory record for the brand. The second dimension of brand equity is brand associations, defined as the memory nodes linked to the corresponding brand node in a consumer\'s memory, which contain the meaning that the brand has for the consumer. There are two key categories of associations--attributes (specific beliefs about the product, service, or organization) and …</div></div></div>|Author|Jakub Sovina and Christopher J Collins|Year|2003|Publisher|Academy of Management|Citedby|12|Eprint|http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=conference', '|Title|Changing an unfavorable employer reputation: the roles of recruitment message‐type and familiarity with employer|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">An unfavorable employer reputation can impair an organization\'s ability to recruit job seekers. The present research used a 4 week longitudinal experimental design to investigate whether recruitment messages can positively change an existing unfavorable employer reputation. Two hundred and twenty‐two job seekers rated their perceptions of an organization before and after being randomly assigned to receive a series of high‐or low‐information recruitment messages. As expected, job seekers receiving high‐information messages changed their perceptions more than job seekers who were exposed to low‐information messages. In addition, job seekers\' initial familiarity with the employer was negatively related to change in their perceptions of employer reputation. Finally, there was some evidence that job seekers\' familiarity with the employer influenced the impact of different recruitment messages.

The authors argue that the unique problems underlying exploration innovation strategies and exploitation innovation strategies require core workers to engage in different types of knowledge-search and -combination behaviors. Alternative HR systems theoretically produce different knowledge-search and -combination behaviors by way of their effect on employees’ ability, motivation, and opportunity structures at work. Drawing on a field study of 230 software firms, the authors demonstrate that alternative HR systems support either an exploration or exploitation strategy and that alignment between a firm’s HR system and innovation strategy results in firm performance gains and …</div></div></div>|Author|Christopher Collins and Rebecca Kehoe|Year|2017|Publisher|SAGE Publications|Citedby|9|Eprint|http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2203&context=articles', '|Title|Strategic decision-making in high velocity environments: A theory revisited and a test|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">[Excerpt] A decade ago, Eisenhardt (1989) proposed a model of strategic decision-making speed for firms facing high-velocity environments. This theory, while important at the time, has become even more relevant to the strategy-making bodies of firms in the entrepreneurial millennium. The model differed in important ways from much of the existing literature on decision-making speed (Frederickson and Mitchell, 1984; Janis, 1982; Mintzberg, et al., 1976; Nutt, 1976). Eisenhardt\'s ideas were based on a series of inductive case studies of eight firms competing in the fast-paced micro-chip industry. As such, it was an important theory-building effort in a central area of strategy process, strategic decision-making. To date, however, there have been no attempts to comprehensively test the model with a larger sample of firms.</div></div></div>|Author|Kevin Clark and Christopher J Collins|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|7|Eprint|https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1575&context=articles', '|Title|Changing an unfavorable employment reputation: A longitudinal examination|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Although a favorable employment reputation plays an important role in generating a large and qualified pool of job applicants for an organization (Rynes &amp; Cable, 2003), little research has investigated whether organizations can improve applicants’ existing unfavorable employment reputation perceptions. Results from a four-week longitudinal experiment using 222 student job seekers revealed that participants’ employment reputation perceptions improved after exposure to recruitment practices and followed diminishing returns trajectories over time. High information recruitment practices (eg, personal communication from a recruiter) from both single and multiple sources were more effective for changing unfavorable employment reputation perceptions than repeated mere exposure to the organization (ie, exposure to only the company logo), and high information practices from multiple sources were the most effective overall. Finally, participants reporting less familiarity with the organization experienced greater reputation change across the four weeks, but only for participants in the mere exposure condition.</div></div></div>|Author|Adam M Kanar and Christopher J Collins and Bradford S Bell|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|3|Eprint|https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1494&context=cahrswp']"
