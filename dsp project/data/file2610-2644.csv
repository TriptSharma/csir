Two cultivars of potato ‘Diamant’(100 gm and 51 gm per tuber) and ‘LalPakri (23 gm and 11 gm per tuber) were placed on four shelves of the bin. Each shelf holds 240 kg of potato from 23 march 2013 to December 2013. Potato spoilage, sprouting, shrinkage, moisture content, vitamin C and total sugar content of potato were measured. Experimental results revealed that potato spoilage progressively increased from April to November and sprouting of potato gradually increased from June to October, but stopped in November. The cumulative spoilage and sprouting were much lower in the improved bin compared to traditional farmer’s practices. Shrinkage of potato was found higher in farmer’s practice than that of storage bin from October to November. Moisture content of potato was higher during May and reduced gradually to the lowest value during November in both of practices. No significant difference was found in two practices on vitamin-C content. Sugar content of ‘Diamant; potato was lower in the storage bin during November.

Direct current (DC) four-point probe potential drop technique was used in this study. Inspection was carried out by providing currents between the outer probes in the specimen to be tested and measuring the arising electrical voltage drop between two inner probes placed on its surface. The presence of a defect generally increased the resistance and hence the voltage drop was measured. However, the principle underlying these techniques is relatively simple. A metallic rod having 3.175 mm diameter covered with plastic fiber was used in each probes as conductor. Inner two probes were used to get accurate value of voltage drop as the outer probes were used for current passing. Compression springs were used between the collar and tail of the probes to keep probes on the sample rigidly during experiment. Five, ten and fifteen amperes of current were being flown from a DC source-12V battery into samples. Mild Steel (MS) flat bar (180× 25× 4 mm), Stainless Steel (SS) flat bar (180× 25× 5 mm) and Carbon Steel (CS) flat bar (180× 37.5× 4 mm) were used as materials of the agricultural machinery parts.

In this study, about 257 consumers’, 19 repairers’ and 3 manufacturers’ sites were visited with questionnaire. For collecting information from manufacturer, it is necessary to contact through e-mail with some manufacturers in abroad. At present about 46 refrigerator brands are available in Bangladesh. LG Butterfly is highly demandable brand due to their installment packages on different occasions. Walton (Bangladeshi refrigerator brand), Samsung, Sony Rangs are also in favourable to the consumers. Almost all of the brands are Chinese. These are cheaper than any well-known refrigerator brand. But these brands are using aluminum compressors and low quality refrigerants. The common complains of the consumers were late ice formulation, noise in the refrigerator. R12, R22, R134a, R600 and R600a are commonly using as refrigerants in Bangladesh.

We provide the first direct experimental evidence for dry adhesion of gecko setae by van der Waals forces, and reject the use of mechanisms relying on high surface polarity, including capillary adhesion. The toes of live Tokay geckos were highly hydrophobic, and adhered equally well to strongly hydrophobic and strongly hydrophilic, polarizable surfaces. Adhesion of a single isolated gecko seta was equally effective on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of a microelectro-mechanical systems force sensor.

Silicon, the most common single material used in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), is an anisotropic crystalline material whose material properties depend on orientation relative to the crystal lattice. This fact means that the correct value of <i>E</i> for analyzing two different designs in silicon may differ by up to 45%. However, perhaps, because of the perceived complexity of the subject, many researchers oversimplify silicon elastic behavior and use inaccurate values for design and analysis.

A fundamental limit to the detection of small forces is imposed by thermomechanical noise, the mechanical analog of Johnson noise, which is governed by dissipation of mechanical energy. This paper reports on measurements of the mechanical quality factor Q for arrays of silicon-nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon cantilevers. By studying the dependence of Q on cantilever material, geometry, and surface treatments, significant insight into dissipation mechanisms has been obtained. For submicron-thick cantilevers, Q is found to decrease with decreasing cantilever thickness, indicating surface loss mechanisms.

The 1/f fluctuations of piezoresistive cantilevers are shown to vary inversely with the total number of carriers in the piezoresistor, as formulated by Hooge in 1969. Therefore, while 1/f noise is reduced for large heavily doped cantilevers, sensitivity considerations favor thin lightly doped cantilevers. Balancing these conflicting constraints produces optima for many design and processing parameters. For a cantilever with specified spring constant and bandwidth requirements, optima are identified for the beam thickness and length, and it is shown that the legs should be between 1/3 and 2/3 of the total length with a doping depth that is 1/3 of the beam thickness.

This novel operator acts as variety of path quantifier allowing us to consider paths which deviate from the desired behaviour of the system.

To better understand this function, we performed immuno-precipitation followed by mass-spectrometry proteomics to identify proteins interacting with the NMMHCIIA-enriched actin-myosin complexes. Computational analyses revealed that these proteins belong to functional networks including regulators of cytoskeletal organization, metabolism and networks regulated by the HIV-1 gene nef. We further characterized the subcellular localization of NMMHCIIA within podocytes in vivo, and found it to be present within the podocyte major foot processes. Finally, we tested the effect of loss of MYH9 expression in podocytes in vitro, and found that it was necessary for cytoskeletal organization.

The genetic factors predisposing to obesity are poorly understood. A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes–susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the <i>FTO</i> (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16% of adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7 years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass.</div></div></div>|Author|Timothy M Frayling and Nicholas J Timpson and Michael N Weedon and Eleftheria Zeggini and Rachel M Freathy and Cecilia M Lindgren and John RB Perry and Katherine S Elliott and Hana Lango and Nigel W Rayner and Beverley Shields and Lorna W Harries and Jeffrey C Barrett and Sian Ellard and Christopher J Groves and Bridget Knight and Ann-Marie Patch and Andrew R Ness and Shah Ebrahim and Debbie A Lawlor and Susan M Ring and Yoav Ben-Shlomo and Marjo-Riitta Jarvelin and Ulla Sovio and Amanda J Bennett and David Melzer and Luigi Ferrucci and Ruth JF Loos and Inês Barroso and Nicholas J Wareham and Fredrik Karpe and Katharine R Owen and Lon R Cardon and Mark Walker and Graham A Hitman and Colin NA Palmer and Alex SF Doney and Andrew D Morris and George Davey Smith and Andrew T Hattersley and Mark I McCarthy|Year|2007|Publisher|American Association for the Advancement of Science|Citedby|3883|Eprint|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646098/?_escaped_fragment_=po=12.5000', '|Title|Replication of genome-wide association signals in UK samples reveals risk loci for type 2 diabetes|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood.

In most cases, individual polymorphisms only moderately increase risk (~20%), and they are thought to be unhelpful in assessing individuals\' risk clinically. The value of analyzing multiple alleles simultaneously is not well studied. This is often because, for any given disease, very few common risk alleles have been confirmed.   Methods and Findings Three common variants (Lys23 of KCNJ11, Pro12 of PPARG, and the T allele at rs7903146 of TCF7L2) have been shown to predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus across many large studies. Risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.30 to 0.88 in controls. To assess the combined effect of multiple susceptibility alleles, we genotyped these variants in a large case-control study (3,668 controls versus 2,409 cases). Individual allele odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.23) to 1.48 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.60). We found no evidence of gene-gene interaction, and the risks of multiple alleles were consistent with a multiplicative model. Each additional risk allele increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 1.28 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.35) times. Participants with all six risk alleles had an OR of 5.71 (95% CI, 1.15 to 28.3) compared to those with no risk alleles.

Its aetiological agent (IPNV) was the first virus to be isolated from teleosts (Wolf et al., 1960) and the disease and the virus have been associated intimately with the development of fish and aquatic animal virology. Due to its distinct biophysical characteristics, IPN virus became the archetype of a new family of viruses, the birnaviruses, denoting its bi-segmented RNA genome (Dobos et al., 1979). Over time, numerous closely related viruses of the same family have been detected in a variety of aquatic species, but with diverse clinical manifestations. Thus, the term ‘aquatic birnaviruses’ has been used to summarize virus family members derived from aquatic animals and environments, while the term ‘IPNV’is used for aquatic birnaviruses isolated from or causing disease in salmonid species. A number of comprehensive reviews have been published on the IPN disease and its causative virus (Wolf, 1966, 1988; McAllister, 1979; Hill, 1982; Reno, 1999). During the past 10 years, research has continued, focusing on molecular markers of virulence, host–pathogen relationships, epidemiology, on the role of inducing factors in disease manifestation and on the development of new and more effective methods for its control in commercial salmonid farming. Major progress has been made in vaccination against IPN, in selective breeding and in the search for genomic markers of resistance to IPN in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout</div></div></div>|Author|Eann S Munro and Paul J Midtlyng|Year|1970|Publisher|CABI|Citedby|136|Eprint|', '|Title|Phylum myxozoa|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Myxozoans are highly specialized metazoan parasites of aquatic hosts with a very wide host range.

However, when fish are cultured in high numbers and are stressed by adverse environmental factors (e.g. heavy metal pollution, low dissolved oxygen, nutritional deficiencies, and/or overcrowding), parasites may have the advantage and the risk of disease outbreak increases in the fish population. We know very little about innate immunity against parasites. Hence it has not been considered a viable strategy to protect fish from diseases.

This method has been widely applied to characterize the micro-scale stiffness for a variety of materials ranging from metal surfaces to soft biological tissues and cells. The basic principle of this method is to indent a cell with an AFM tip of selected geometry and measure the applied force from the bending of the AFM cantilever.

Viral infection in plants induces a potent and highly specific antiviral RNA silencing response characterized by the formation of virus-derived siRNAs. Arabidopsis thaliana has ten AGO genes of which AGO1, AGO2, and AGO7 have been shown to play roles in antiviral defense. A genetic analysis was used to identify and characterize the roles of AGO proteins in antiviral defense against Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in Arabidopsis. AGO1, AGO2 and AGO10 promoted anti-TuMV defense in a modular way in various organs, with AGO2 providing a prominent antiviral role in leaves. AGO5, AGO7 and AGO10 had minor effects in leaves. AGO1 and AGO10 had overlapping antiviral functions in inflorescence tissues after systemic movement of the virus, although the roles of AGO1 and AGO10 accounted for only a minor amount of the overall antiviral activity. By combining AGO protein immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing of associated small RNAs, AGO2, AGO10, and to a lesser extent AGO1 were shown to associate with siRNAs derived from silencing suppressor (HC-Pro)-deficient TuMV-AS9, but not with siRNAs derived from wild-type TuMV.

Highly malignant renal carcinoma cancer cells fail to form <i>in vivo</i> tumors in the absence of ADAM17, confirming the essential function of this molecule in tumorigenesis. These data show that …</div></div></div>|Author|Aleksandra Franovic and Isabelle Robert and Karlene Smith and Ghada Kurban and Arnim Pause and Lakshman Gunaratnam and Stephen Lee|Year|2006|Publisher|American Association for Cancer Research|Citedby|73|Eprint|http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/66/16/8083.full.pdf', '|Title|Community‐based approaches for prevention of mother to child transmission in resource‐poor settings: a social ecological review|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Introduction</h3> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Numerous barriers to optimal uptake of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services occur at community level (i.e., outside the healthcare setting). To achieve elimination of paediatric HIV, therefore, interventions must also work within communities to address these barriers and increase service use and need to be informed by evidence. This paper reviews community‐based approaches that have been used in resource‐limited settings to increase rates of PMTCT enrolment, retention in care and successful treatment outcomes. It aims to identify which interventions work, why they may do so and what knowledge gaps remain.</div> <h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Methods</h3> <div class=""gsh_csp"">First, we identified barriers to PMTCT that originate outside the health system.

We have assessed the kinetic properties of the murine double minute protein (MDM2) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligases in living cells under physiological conditions that alter the stability of their respective p53 and hypoxia-inducible factor substrates. Photobleaching experiments reveal that MDM2 and VHL are highly mobile proteins in settings where their substrates are efficiently degraded. The nucleolar architecture converts MDM2 and VHL to a static state in response to regulatory cues that are associated with substrate stability. After signal termination, the nucleolus is able to rapidly release these proteins from static detention, thereby restoring their high mobility profiles. A protein surface region of VHL9s β-sheet domain was identified as a discrete [H+]-responsive nucleolar detention signal that targets the VHL/Cullin-2 …</div></div></div>|Author|Karim Mekhail and Mireille Khacho and Amanda Carrigan and Robert RJ Hache and Lakshman Gunaratnam and Stephen Lee|Year|2005|Publisher|Rockefeller University Press|Citedby|69|Eprint|http://jcb.rupress.org/content/170/5/733.full.pdf+html', '|Title|Role of exon 2-encoded β-domain of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas frequently harbor inactivating mutations in exon 2 of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Here, we examine the effect of the loss of exon 2-encoded β-domain function on VHL biochemical properties. Exon 2-encoded residues are required for VHL-mediated NEDD8 conjugation on cullin-2 and assembly with hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFα) and fibronectin. These residues are not essential for VHL ability to assemble with elongin BC/cullin-2, to display E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and to confer energy-dependent nuclear import properties to a reporter protein. Localization studies in HIF-1α-null embryonic cells suggest that exon 2-encoded β-domain mediates transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of VHL independently of assembly with HIF-1α and oxygen concentration. Exon 3-encoded α− helical domain is required for VHL complex …</div></div></div>|Author|Marie-Eve Bonicalzi and Isabelle Groulx and Natalie De Paulsen and Stephen Lee|Year|2001|Publisher|American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|Citedby|67|Eprint|http://www.jbc.org/content/276/2/1407.full.pdf', '|Title|Environmental cues induce a long noncoding RNA–dependent remodeling of the nucleolus|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The nucleolus is a plurifunctional organelle in which structure and function are intimately linked. Its structural plasticity has long been appreciated, particularly in response to transcriptional inhibition and other cellular stresses, although the mechanism and physiological relevance of these phenomena are unclear. Using MCF-7 and other mammalian cell lines, we describe a structural and functional adaptation of the nucleolus, triggered by heat shock or physiological acidosis, that depends on the expression of ribosomal intergenic spacer long noncoding RNA (IGS lncRNA). At the heart of this process is the de novo formation of a large subnucleolar structure, termed the detention center (DC).

In addition to recycling between a naïve, chaperone-associated cytoplasmic complex and a liganded chaperone-free nuclear form, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been observed to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear export of GR and other nuclear receptors has been proposed to depend on direct interactions with calreticulin, which is predominantly localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that rapid calreticulin-mediated nuclear export of GR is a specific response to transient disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum that occurs during polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion. Using live and digitonin-permeabilized cells we demonstrate that, in the absence of cell fusion, GR nuclear export occurs slowly over a period of many …</div></div></div>|Author|Rhian F Walther and Claudia Lamprecht and Andrew Ridsdale and Isabelle Groulx and Stephen Lee and Yvonne A Lefebvre and Robert JG Haché|Year|2003|Publisher|American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|Citedby|47|Eprint|http://www.jbc.org/content/278/39/37858.full.pdf']"
