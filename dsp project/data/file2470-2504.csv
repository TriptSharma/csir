Vaccination is highly efficacious for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of rabies in humans and animals, and prompt postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with vaccine and rabies immune globulin (RIG) can reliably prevent disease in humans. However, access to these tools and knowledge of their proper use are often limited, especially in impoverished, rabies-enzootic countries with the highest disease burden. In the absence of reliable diagnostic capacity and risk assessments, vaccines and RIG are often administered inappropriately, leading to chronic supply shortages and otherwise preventable deaths.

Dog vaccination campaigns implemented through collaborative effort between the government and NGOs have played an important role in successfully reducing the burden of disease within the country. Nevertheless, rabies vaccination of the domestic animal population requires continuous commitment not only from governments and NGOs, but also from local communities that are directly affected by such efforts. To create such long-term sustained programs, the introduction of affordable dog vaccination and registration fees is essential and has been shown to be an important strategy in Bohol, Philippines. The aim of this study, therefore, was to estimate the average amount of money that individuals were willing to pay for dog vaccination and registration in Ilocos Norte, Philippines. This study also investigated some of the determinants of individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP).

We built a spreadsheet tool, RabiesEcon, to aid public health officials to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dog rabies vaccination programs in East Africa.   Methods RabiesEcon uses a mathematical model of dog-dog and dog-human rabies transmission to estimate dog rabies cases averted, the cost per human rabies death averted and cost per year of life gained (YLG) due to dog vaccination programs (US 2015 dollars). We used an East African human population of 1 million (approximately 2/3 living in urban setting, 1/3 rural). We considered, using data from the literature, three vaccination options; no vaccination, annual vaccination of 50% of dogs and 20% of dogs vaccinated semi-annually. We assessed 2 transmission scenarios: low (1.2 dogs infected per infectious dog) and high (1.7 dogs infected). We also examined the impact of annually vaccinating 70% of all dogs (World Health Organization recommendation for dog rabies elimination).   Results Without dog vaccination, over 10 years there would a total of be approximately 44,000–65,000 rabid dogs and 2,100–2,900 human deaths. Annually vaccinating 50% of dogs results in 10-year reductions of 97% and 75% in rabid dogs (low and high transmissions scenarios, respectively), approximately 2,000–1,600 human deaths averted, and an undiscounted cost-effectiveness of $451-$385 per life saved.

Two ORV bait designs are primarily utilized for the distribution of vaccinia rabies glycoprotein (VRG) vaccine: a fish meal polymer block and a coated sachet. A primary public health concern related to ORV bait distribution is non-target contact between the ORV and humans and domestic pets. The VRG virus strain used in ORV is attenuated in mice, but human percutaneous exposure to ruptured sachets has resulted in localized vaccinia virus infection in very rare cases. Recently, a new recombinant human adenovirus ORV (AdRG) has been developed. This vaccine is incorporated in ultralight bait which has not previously been used in the United States. Surveillance for human contact is important, particularly among young children that may have contact with the bait, due to their lower prevalence of prior exposure and immunity to human adenoviruses. To evaluate potential differences in contact rates between the VRG and AdRG bait types CDC, the Ohio Department of Health, and USDA/WS will conduct an investigation during ORV baiting in Northeastern Ohio in August 2012. The focus of this investigation will be to ensure that public health programs are in place to capture events of human and domestic animal bait contact, ensure appropriate protocols are in place in case of a severe adverse event from a bait contact, and evaluate whether the AdRG vaccine bait matrix is associated with a different human detection rate compared to bait types used for distributing VRG.

The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), based on physiological parameters, is validated in adult medical and surgical patients as a predictor of mortality. The objective of this study performed in Uganda was to determine the prevalence of critical illness on the wards as defined by the MEWS, to evaluate the MEWS as a predictor of death, and to describe additional risk factors for mortality.   Methods We conducted a prospective observational study at Mulago National Referral Teaching Hospital in Uganda. We included medical and surgical ward patients over 18 years old, excluding patients discharged the day of enrolment, obstetrical patients, and patients who self-discharged prior to study completion. Over a 72-hour study period, we collected demographic and vital signs, and calculated MEWS; at 7-days we measured outcomes. Patients discharged prior to 7 days were assumed to be alive at study completion. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed.

A wide repertoire of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes is present in K. pneumoniae genomes, which can constitute extra challenges in the treatment of infections caused by some strains. K. pneumoniae Kp13 is a multidrug-resistant strain responsible for causing a large nosocomial outbreak in a teaching hospital located in Southern Brazil. Kp13 produces K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-2) but is unrelated to isolates belonging to ST 258 and ST 11, the main clusters associated with the worldwide dissemination of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. In this report, we perform a genomic comparison between Kp13 and each of the following three K. pneumoniae genomes: MGH 78578, NTUH-K2044 and 342. We have completely determined the genome of K. pneumoniae Kp13, which comprises one chromosome (5.3 Mbp) and six plasmids (0.43 Mbp). Several virulence and resistance determinants were identified in strain Kp13. Specifically, we detected genes coding for six beta-lactamases (SHV-12, OXA-9, TEM-1, CTX-M-2, SHV-110 and KPC-2), eight adhesin-related gene clusters, including regions coding for types 1 (fim) and 3 (mrk) fimbrial adhesins. The rmtG plasmidial 16S rRNA methyltransferase gene was also detected, as well as efflux pumps belonging to five different families.

CPS production is driven mostly by the expression of genes located in a locus called cps, and the resulting structure is used to distinguish between different serotypes (K types). In this study, we report the unique genetic organization of the cps cluster from K. pneumoniae Kp13, a clinical isolate recovered during a large outbreak of nosocomial infections that occurred in a Brazilian teaching hospital. A pyrosequencing-based approach showed that the cps region of Kp13 (cpsKp13) is 26.4 kbp in length and contains genes common, although not universal, to other strains, such as the rmlBADC operon that codes for L-rhamnose synthesis. cpsKp13 also presents some unique features, like the inversion of the wzy gene and a unique repertoire of glycosyltransferases. In silico comparison of cpsKp13 RFLP pattern with 102 previously published cps PCR-RFLP patterns showed that cpsKp13 is distinct from the C patterns of all other K serotypes. Furthermore, in vitro serotyping showed only a weak reaction with capsular types K9 and K34. We confirm that K9 cps shares common genes with cpsKp13 such as the rmlBADC operon, but lacks features like uge and Kp13-specific glycosyltransferases, while K34 capsules contain three of the five sugars that potentially form the Kp13 CPS.

Many K. pneumoniae infections can only be treated when resorting to last-line drugs such as polymyxin B (PB). However, resistance to this antibiotic is also observed, although insufficient information is described on its mode of action as well as the mechanisms used by resistant bacteria to evade its effects. We aimed to study PB resistance and the influence of abiotic stresses in a clinical K. pneumoniae strain using whole transcriptome profiling. We sequenced 12 cDNA libraries of K. pneumoniae Kp13 bacteria, from two biological replicates of the original strain Kp13 (Kp13) and five derivative strains: induced high-level PB resistance in acidic pH (Kp13pH), magnesium deprivation (Kp13Mg), high concentrations of calcium (Kp13Ca) and iron (Kp13Fe), and a control condition with PB (Kp13PolB). Our results show the involvement of multiple regulatory loci that differentially respond to each condition as well as a shared gene expression response elicited by PB treatment, and indicate the participation of two-regulatory components such as ArcA-ArcB, which could be involved in re-routing the K. pneumoniae metabolism following PB treatment. Modules of co-expressed genes could be determined, which correlated to growth in acid stress and PB exposure. We hypothesize that polymyxin B induces metabolic shifts in K. pneumoniae that could relate to surviving against the action of this antibiotic.

Eighty-three clinical isolates initially identified as carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were collected from nosocomial infections in southeast Brazil. After RAPD screening, the KPC-142 isolate, showing the most divergent DNA pattern, was selected for complete genome sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Reads were assembled into scaffolds, gaps between scaffolds were resolved by in silico gap filling and extensive bioinformatics analyses were performed, using multiple comparative analysis tools and databases. Genome sequencing allowed to correct the classification of the KPC-142 isolate as K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae. To the best of our knowledge this is the first complete genome reported to date of a clinical isolate of this subspecies harbouring both class A beta-lactamases KPC-2 and OKP-B-6 from South America.

Previous transcriptomic studies have been performed to elucidate altered pathways in response to viral infection. However, the intrinsic coupling between alimentation and infection were unappreciated in these studies. Feeding is required for the initial mosquito contact with the virus and these events are highly dependent. Addressing this relationship, we re-interrogated datasets of virus-infected mosquitoes with two different diet schemes (fed and unfed mosquitoes), evaluating the metabolic cross-talk during both processes. We constructed co-expression networks with the differentially expressed genes of these comparison: virus-infected versus blood-fed mosquitoes and virus-infected versus unfed mosquitoes. Our analysis identified one module with 110 genes that correlated with infection status (representing ~0.7% of the Ae. aegypti genome). Furthermore, we performed a machine-learning approach and summarized the infection status using only four genes (AAEL012128, AAEL014210, AAEL002477 and AAEL005350). While three of the four genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins, AAEL012128 gene is a membrane amino acid transporter correlated to viral envelope binding.

In this study, sequences deposited in the M. perniciosa Genome Sequencing Project database were analyzed to identify potential biological targets. For the first time, the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in M. perniciosa was studied and the lanosterol 14α-demethylase gene (ERG11) that encodes the main enzyme of this pathway and is a target for fungicides was cloned, characterized molecularly and its phylogeny analyzed. ERG11 genomic DNA and cDNA were characterized and sequence analysis of the ERG11 protein identified highly conserved domains typical of this enzyme, such as SRS1, SRS4, EXXR and the heme-binding region (HBR).

This is particularly pertinent for parasitic infections of the tropics and sub-tropics, referred to collectively as neglected tropical diseases, where the commercial incentives to develop new drugs are weak. One such disease is schistosomiasis, a highly prevalent acute and chronic condition caused by a parasitic helminth infection, with three species of the genus Schistosoma infecting humans. Currently, a single 40-year old drug, praziquantel, is available to treat all infective species, but its use in mass drug administration is leading to signs of drug-resistance emerging. To meet the challenge of developing new therapeutics against this disease, we developed an innovative computational drug repurposing pipeline supported by phenotypic screening. The approach highlighted several protein kinases as interesting new biological targets for schistosomiasis as they play an essential role in many parasite’s biological processes. Focusing on this target class, we also report the first elucidation of the kinome of Schistosoma japonicum, as well as updated kinomes of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. In comparison with the human kinome, we explored these kinomes to identify potential targets of existing inhibitors which are unique to Schistosoma species, allowing us to identify novel targets and suggest approved drugs that might inhibit them.

The mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are not completely understood and little is known about posttranscriptional regulation during LCL. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that regulates gene expression, which can be implicated in the pathogenesis of LCL. Then, we investigated the involvement of miRNAs and their targets genes in human LCL using publicly available transcriptome data sets, followed by ex vivo validation. Initial analysis highlighted that miRNAs expression is altered during LCL, clustering patients separately from controls. Joint analysis identified 8 high confidence miRNAs altered (-1.5≤fold change≥1.5; p&lt;0.05) between cutaneous ulcers and uninfected skin. We found that the expression of miR-193b and miR-671 are greatly associated with their target genes, CD40 and TNFR, indicating an important role of these miRNAs in the expression of genes related to the inflammatory response observed in LCL. Besides, network analysis revealed that, miR-193b, miR-671 and TREM1 correlate only in patients that shows faster wound healing (up to 59 days) than in patients with longer time of cure (more than 60 days). Given that these miRNAs are associated with the control of inflammation and time of healing, our findings reveal that they might influence the pathogenesis and prognosis of LCL.</div></div>|Author|Sara Nunes and Icaro Bonyek Silva and Mariana Rosa Ampuero and Almério Libório Lopes de Noronha and Lígia Correia Lima de Souza and Thaizza Cavalcante Correia and Ricardo Khouri and Viviane Sampaio Boaventura and Aldina Barral and Pablo Ivan Pereira Ramos and Cláudia Brodskyn and Pablo Rafael Silveira Oliveira and Natalia Machado Tavares|Year|2018|Publisher|Frontiers|Citedby|1|Eprint|https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00640', '|Title|Unveiling the kinomes of Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis empowers the discovery of new kinase targets and antileishmanial compounds|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the genus <i>Leishmania</i> (NTD) endemic in 98 countries.

More recently, a new study of Ae. aegypti infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) was published, providing new data to investigate whether this “infection” gene set is also altered during a ZIKV infection. Our hypothesis is that the infection-associated signature may also serve as a proxy to classify the ZIKV infection in the vector. Raw data associated with the NCBI/BioProject were downloaded and re-analysed. A total of 18 paired-end replicates corresponding to three ZIKV-infected samples and three controls were included in this study. The nMDS technique with a logistic regression was used to obtain the probabilities of belonging to a given class.

PTSD is moderately heritable, but few specific molecular variants accounting for this heritability have been identified. Genes regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, such as corticotrophin-releasing hormone type 1 receptor gene (CRHR1), have been implicated in traumatic-stress related phenotypes but have yet to be studied in relation to PTSD. The present study sought to examine the relation between 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRHR1 gene and posttraumatic stress symptoms in a prospective study of pediatric injury patients (n = 103) who were first assessed in the acute aftermath of their injury at the hospital. Results indicated that multiple SNPs were associated with acute symptoms at a univariate level, and after correction for multiple testing, rs12944712 was significantly related to acute PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal latent growth curve analyses suggest that rs12944712 is also related to both acute symptom level and trajectory of symptoms over time. The present study adds support for the role of CRHR1 in the stress response following potentially traumatic event exposure in youth. It should be noted that the sample size in this study was small, and therefore statistical power was low; following, results from this study should be considered preliminary. Although results are not definitive, the findings from this study warrant future replication studies on how variation in this gene relates to response to traumatic event exposure in youth.</div></div>|Author|Ananda B Amstadter and Nicole R Nugent and Bao-Zhu Yang and Alisa Miller and Richie Siburian and Priya Moorjani and Stephen Haddad and Aditi Basu and Jesen Fagerness and Glenn Saxe and Jordan W Smoller and Karestan C Koenen|Year|1970|Publisher|Hindawi|Citedby|84|Eprint|https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2011/928497.pdf', '|Title|The efficacy of initial hydrocortisone administration at preventing posttraumatic distress in adult trauma patients: a randomized trial|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><b>Objective/Introduction</b><div class=""gsh_csp"">Secondary pharmacological interventions have shown promise at reducing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS) in preclinical studies.

Unlike acoustic instruments, digital musical instruments have no coupling between the sound generation system and the physical interface with which the performer interacts. As a result of this, such instruments also lack the direct physical feedback to the performer which is present in an acoustic instrument. In fact in contrast to acoustic musical instruments, haptic and vibrotactile feedback is generally not present in a DMI contributing to a poor feel for the instrument. The main goal of this thesis is to propose ways to improve the overall feel of digital musical instruments through the study and design of its physical interface: the instrument body, sensors and feedback actuators. It includes a detailed study of the existing theory and practice of the design on physical interfaces for digital musical instruments, including a survey of 266 existing DMIs presented since the inception of the NIME conference.

They are also more complex for the audience to understand, due to the diversity of their components and the magical aspect of the musicians\' actions when compared to acoustic instruments. This complexity results in a loss of liveness and possibly a poor experience for the audience. Our approach, called Rouages, is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application. Rouages reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifying musicians\' gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representing the sound compo- nents with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing the impact of musicians\' gestures on these components. In its current implementation, it focuses on MIDI controllers as input devices. We believe that Rouages opens up new perspectives for instrument makers and musicians to improve audience experience with their digital musical instruments.</div></div>|Author|Florent Berthaut and Mark Marshall and Sriram Subramanian and Martin Hachet|Year|2013|Publisher||Citedby|28|Eprint|https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00807049/file/rouages.pdf', '|Title|Examining How Musicians Create Augmented Musical Instruments.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This paper examines the creation of augmented musical instruments by a number of musicians.

Here we present two instances of co-design of museum visiting aids, one stemming from an open brief, another from an initial working prototype; we discuss the process in each case and discuss how these alternative strategies presented the team with different possibilities as well as constraints, and led to different patterns of collaboration within the design team.

We use ubiquitous computing to create reactive spaces and smart objects that seamlessly blend with the surroundings or the exhibition and bridge the gap between the physical and the digital. The technology is intentionally concealed to bring places and stories from the past into the present and create immersive experiences where technology complements heritage (as opposed to compete with it for visitors’ attention). The full integration of technology with the exhibition or heritage requires approaching the design of the visitors’ experience as a collaborative project that combines curatorial, technical and design aspects. As a multi-expertise team, we created, implemented, and evaluated thee concepts: an evocative experience in the trenches and camp of World War I in the Italian Alps; an interactive layer to tell the personal stories of those involved in the changes in The Hague during the Nazi occupation; and a set of multimedia installations to enrich a permanent collection of World War I artillery. The design effort was on both the creation of bespoke devices and the composition of content that was not didactic but open to personal interpretation: curators left traces for visitors to pick up, and when this occurred the experience was deeper and stronger. Our evaluations show that the powerful outcome cannot be ascribed to just one component, technology versus content. One empowers the other: an approach that simultaneously works on interaction and content is essential to make a design that exploits the place or the objects to a powerful final effect …</div></div>|Author|Daniela Petrelli and Nick Dulake and Mark Marshall and Hub Kockelkorn and Anna Pisetti|Year|2016|Publisher||Citedby|13|Eprint|http://shura.shu.ac.uk/12181/3/Petrelli%20Do%20it%20together.pdf', '|Title|Virtual sculpture-Gesture controlled system for artistic expression|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This paper describes the development of a gesture-based interface system for interactive multimedia applications.

Thus, our findings provide evidence that when the SEC filings contain material new information, investors incorporate it in pricing the firms’ shares. We also find that market reactions are stronger for cases of downward earnings revisions than upward earnings revisions, but that an inverse drift in abnormal returns occurs for upward earnings revisions beyond the SEC filing date.

Directors, however, normally owe fiduciary duties to equity holders, not creditors. We examine whether this slant in fiduciary duties affects the likelihood that firms will use financial engineering to circumvent debt covenants. By avoiding debt covenants, firms prevent creditors from taking actions to reduce bankruptcy risk and recover their investment, and allow the firm to continue operating for the benefit of equity holders. We find that a Delaware court ruling that imposed fiduciary duties toward creditors led to a decrease in financial engineering and debt-covenant avoidance in Delaware firms. We also show that board quality lowers the probability that firms will avoid covenants only when directors owe a legal fiduciary duty to creditors. Collectively, our results suggest that unless directors are required to protect creditors’ interest, they are likely to take actions to circumvent debt covenants.</div></div></div>|Author|Shai Levi and Benjamin Segal and Dan Segal|Year|2016|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|', '|Title|Do Firms Hedge Optimally?

Using new proxies for the extent of financial risk management in non-financial firms we find that treated firms reduce their financial hedging, in a difference-in-difference framework. The reduction is concentrated in firms with higher conflicts of interests, such as a high CEO equity ownership level, which exposes them to more idiosyncratic risk, and a higher occurrence of option backdating. We reject the hypothesis that newly majority-independent boards reduce financial hedging due to a lack of knowledge. First, we find no difference in financial hedging for firms where SOX mandated the addition of a financial expert relative to those that already had such expertise. Second, shareholder value increases more during the period of time of the listing rule deliberations for treated firms that hedge prior to the treatment. We conclude that some firms hedge too much reducing shareholder value potentially to the benefit of under-diversified CEOs. We also show that board independence serves to reinforce monitoring which allows boards to cut back on excessive financial hedging.</div></div></div>|Author|Sterling Huang and Urs Peyer and Benjamin Segal|Year|2013|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2344&context=soa_research']"

These effects are opposite to those resulting from prenatal stress (PS). We examined the interaction between PS and handling on nociception in adult male and female rats. Randomly selected pregnant rats were subjected to restraint stress on days 13–17 of gestation for 25 min each day, or left undisturbed. At birth, selected stressed/nonstressed litters were assigned to be handled. Handling consisted of 15 min of separation from the dam, once per day, from postnatal days 1–14. At 4 months of age, rats were placed on a 50°C hot plate, and their latencies to paw lick were recorded. Prenatal stress and handling interacted to affect latencies in male rats. Handled (H)/PS rats had significantly lower paw lick latencies than nonhandled (NH)/PS rats (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

Here, we examined the extent to which testosterone and cortisol responses to social exclusion would predict subsequent reactive aggression. Men were randomly assigned to a social exclusion (SE) or inclusion (SI) condition of ‘Cyberball’, a computer ball-toss game. Aggression was then measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Saliva was collected at three points for the measurement of testosterone and cortisol. Regression analyses indicated that testosterone concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball testosterone) were positively correlated with aggressive behaviour, irrespective of SI/SE. Post hoc analyses for the conditions separately, however, suggested the relationship was stronger for SI men (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup><sub>change</sub> = 13.3%, <i>F</i> …</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|Shawn N Geniole and Justin M Carré and Cheryl M McCormick|Year|2011|Publisher|Elsevier|Citedby|90|Eprint|https://snelab.nipissingu.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2014/10/GenioleCarreMcCormick-2011-Biol-Psych.pdf', '|Title|Social instability in adolescence alters the central and peripheral hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal responses to a repeated homotypic stressor in male and female rats|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">There has been little research on effects of chronic stressors on neuroendocrine function in adolescence despite increasing evidence of enduring effects of stressors during this period on behaviour in adulthood.

Both groups had increased plasma corticosterone levels in response to restraint, but corticosterone levels were higher in ISO than in NH. Brain allopregnanolone (3α,5α-THP) levels also increased in response to stress, but NH and ISO did not differ. Sex of the rats was not a factor for any of the measures except plasma corticosterone levels, where females had higher levels than males.

Furthermore, observers\' estimates of aggression from emotionally neutral faces are accurate and are highly correlated with the facial width-to-height ratio. We investigated whether observers use the facial width-to-height ratio to estimate propensity for aggression. In experiments 1a–1c, estimates of aggression remained accurate when faces were blurred or cropped, manipulations that reduce featural cues but maintain the facial width-to-height ratio. Accuracy decreased when faces were scrambled, a manipulation that retains featural information but disrupts the facial width-to-height ratio. In experiment 2, computer-modeling software identified eight facial metrics that correlated with estimates of aggression; regression analyses revealed that the facial width-to-height ratio …</div></div></div>|Author|Justin M Carré and Mark D Morrissey and Catherine J Mondloch and Cheryl M McCormick|Year|2010|Publisher|SAGE Publications|Citedby|81|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheryl_Mccormick/publication/44594680_Estimating_Aggression_from_Emotionally_Neutral_Faces_Which_Facial_Cues_Are_Diagnostic/links/00b7d5230acba328d7000000.pdf', '|Title|Social instability stress in adolescent male rats alters hippocampal neurogenesis and produces deficits in spatial location memory in adulthood|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The ongoing development of the hippocampus in adolescence may be vulnerable to stressors. The effects of social instability stress (SS) in adolescence (daily 1 h isolation and change of cage partner postnatal days 30–45) on cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) in adolescence (on days 33 and 46, experiment 1) and in adulthood (experiment 2) was examined in Long Evans male rats and compared to nonstressed controls (CTL). Additionally, in experiment 2, a separate group of SS and CTL rats was tested on either a spatial (hippocampal‐dependent) or nonspatial (nonhippocampal dependent) version of an object memory test and also were used to investigate hippocampal expression of markers of synaptic plasticity. No memory impairment was evident until the SS rats were adults, and the impairment was only on the spatial test. SS rats initially (postnatal day 33) had increased cell proliferation based on …</div></div></div>|Author|Cheryl M McCormick and Catherine M Thomas and Cheryl S Sheridan and Feather Nixon and Jennifer A Flynn and Iva Z Mathews|Year|2012|Publisher|Wiley-Blackwell|Citedby|80|Eprint|', '|Title|Effects of prenatal protein malnutrition and neonatal stress on CNS responsiveness|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Maturation of the nervous system and consequent behavior depends in part on prenatal nutritional factors and postnatal environmental stimulation. In particular, the hypothalamus and the hippocampus are two important CNS areas that are vulnerable to such pre- and postnatal manipulations. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to explore the effects of both prenatal protein malnutrition and neonatal isolation stress on hypothalamic and hippocampal functioning in infant rats. Specifically, we assessed the levels of plasma corticosterone, as well as dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus in rat pups that had been prenatally malnourished (6% casein diet) and isolated from nest, dam, and siblings for 1 h daily during postnatal days (PND) 2 through 8. We found that on PND 9 malnourished pups weighed less, had smaller hypothalami and a suppressed …</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|Priscilla Kehoe and Kathy Mallinson and Joseph Bronzino and Cheryl M McCormick|Year|2001|Publisher|Elsevier|Citedby|74|Eprint|', '|Title|Effects of paced and non-paced mating stimulation on plasma progesterone, 3α-diol and corticosterone|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">In the female rat, gonadal and adrenal progestins and androgens modulate sexual receptivity and in turn, their levels increase in response to mating stimulation. Paced mating, in which the female controls the timing of sexual contacts with the male, is particularly effective at eliciting acute increases in progesterone (P) and 5α-Androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-Diol). Interestingly, restraint stress produces comparable increases in P and 3α-Diol levels, as well as increases in corticosterone (CORT) levels. In this study, we explored the possibility that paced mating would be associated with increased CORT, in conjunction with mating-induced increases in P and 3α-Diol. Ovariectomized rats primed with estradiol benzoate (10 μg in oil SC) and P (0.5 mg in oil s.c.) received a single ejaculatory series from males in paced or non-paced mating tests. Fifteen minutes post-mating, rats were exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> and rapidly decapitated …</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|Cheryl A Frye and Cheryl M McCormick and Carol Coopersmith and Mary S Erskine|Year|1996|Publisher|Pergamon|Citedby|72|Eprint|']"
