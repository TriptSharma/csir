The fee-for-service (FFS) health care system in which physicians enjoyed a great deal of autonomy has become a managed care system in which cost and utilization considerations play a larger role in physician decision making. Although physicians and other health care professionals are still patient advocates, this role often results in a conflict between their own economic interests and their duties to their patients.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Rather than depending on self-sacrificing health care professionals to advocate for them, patients need to assert their own power in the managed care arena.\'One way to gain such power is to use the class action device in litigation aimed at improving medical care quality, cost and access.

Under current Medicare regulations and other health care payers’ policies, patients must abandon the hope of curative treatment before opting for hospice services. As a result, many terminally ill patients access the services late, sometimes a few hours before death. Scholars have proposed that such a barrier to access, present in Medicare, Medicaid and other health insurers’ coverage rules, may be responsible for lower utilization of hospice services and later access to hospice services than has been proven to be beneficial to patients and their families. This problem becomes even more significant, and other barriers beside coverage rules become apparent, when considering the health care needs of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. Not only do patients in racial and ethnic minority groups access hospice late, like the general population, but they also access it in far fewer numbers.

Carewell asserts that Floritan\'s Incompetent Patient Protection Act, 7 Floritan Stat. §§ 711.20-711.22, prevents it from complying with Mrs. Kruzo\'s instructions to terminate Mr. Kruzo\'s medically supplied artificial nutrition and hydration …</div></div></div>|Author|Kathy Cerminara|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|', '|Title|An analysis of H. 701|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">These comments respond to the introduction of House Bill 701 (H701). H701, like its precursor S692 (prefiled in November, 2003 and withdrawn from committee on April 16, 2004), is a misguided example of extreme overreaction to political pressure stemming from one case involving participants who have been tremendously successful in using the media and elected officials to serve their own ends. The title of the proposed act demonstrates its roots, for it was designed to incite emotions and create an image of a healthy person wasting away, in a condition which many people associate with great pain, although research indicates that in fact unmanageable suffering is not involved and “lack of hydration... may even have an analgesic effect.” 1 The bill should be defeated because it infringes on the constitutional rights of Floridians and because it especially would work to the detriment of persons of lower education and socio-economic class as they attempt to exercise their constitutional right to refuse medical treatment.</div></div></div>|Author|Kathy L Cerminara and Shepard Broad Law Center|Year|2005|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|http://ethicscurriculum.med.miami.edu/schiavo/pdf_files/030805-HB701-LegalAnalysis.pdf']"

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID ‘events’(origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or …</div></div></div>|Author|Kate E Jones and Nikkita G Patel and Marc A Levy and Adam Storeygard and Deborah Balk and John L Gittleman and Peter Daszak|Year|2008|Publisher|Nature Publishing Group|Citedby|4008|Eprint|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5960580/', '|Title|The human footprint and the last of the wild: the human footprint is a global map of human influence on the land surface, which suggests that human beings are stewards of …|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Articles sions of 6 billion people add up to a global phenomenon in a way unique to our time. What we need is a way to understand this influence that is global in extent and yet easy to grasp—what we need is a map. Until recently, designing such a map was not possible, because detailed data on human activities at the global scale were unavailable. The fortunate confluence of several factors during the 1990s changed this situation. Rapid advances in earth observation, using satellite technology pioneered by NASA and other space agencies, meant that, for the first time, verifiable global maps of land use and land cover were available (Loveland et al. 2000). The thawing of the cold war and calls for efficiency in government meant that other sources of global geographic data, for example, on roads and railways, were released to the public by the US National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA 1997).

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change.

Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio‐economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes. We overcame this limitation by producing wall‐to‐wall, annual maps of change in woody vegetation and other land‐cover classes between 2001 and 2010 for each of the …</div></div></div>|Author|T Mitchell Aide and Matthew L Clark and H Ricardo Grau and David López‐Carr and Marc A Levy and Daniel Redo and Martha Bonilla‐Moheno and George Riner and María J Andrade‐Núñez and María Muñiz|Year|2013|Publisher||Citedby|428|Eprint|https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/19691/Deforestation_and_Reforestation_of_Latin_Ameri.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', '|Title|Human Security|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Human security will be progressively threatened as the climate changes (robust evidence, high agreement).

We formulate these methods in terms of sequential regression multivariate imputation, which is an iterative procedure in which the missing values of each variable are randomly imputed conditionally on all the other variables in the completed data matrix.

An indirect driver operates more diffusely by altering one or more direct drivers. Global driving forces are categorized as demographic, economic, sociopolitical, cultural and religious, scientific and technological, and physical and biological. Drivers in all categories other than physical and biological are considered indirect. Important direct drivers include changes in climate, plant nutrient use, land conversion, and diseases and invasive species.

The focus on these partnerships grew in part out of despair that conventional intergovernmental diplomacy was unlikely to bear fruit in Johannesburg and that some alternative outcome was necessary to provide the summit with a positive result. But it also grew out of a deeper strategic understanding, shared not only by key summit organizers but also by a broader network of actors involved in implementing sustainable development goals. This strategic understanding of the importance of partnerships was based on a set of realizations that had emerged over recent years. In this article we offer an initial critical assessment of the partnership strategy, based largely on an examination of the partnerships that emerged from the WSSD. The analysis starts with an overview of theoretical conjectures on the role of partnerships in global governance. It then proceeds to evaluate empirically the patterns of WSSD partnership structure and country participation and the implications for effective governance. Our primary conclusions can be summarized as follows:</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">• The rationale for partnerships, in particular their comparative advantage, is underspecified, and the strategy is unlikely to be effective over time unless a more coherent understanding is developed.• The benefits of using the WSSD as a device to promote partnerships was very poorly articulated, and opportunities for more effective …</div></div></div>|Author|Liliana B Andonova and Marc A Levy|Year|1970|Publisher|Earthscan|Citedby|177|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liliana_Andonova/publication/308220373_Franchising_Global_Governance_Making_Sense_of_the_Johannesburg_Type_II_Partnerships/links/541afae90cf2218008bffb54/Franchising-Global-Governance-Making-Sense-of-the-Johannesburg-Type-II-Partnerships.pdf', '|Title|Improving the effectiveness of international environmental institutions|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Our analysis of international environmental institutions has focused on the activities of international organizations.

Our study is limited by the short time during which international activity with regard to protection of the environment has been intense, and by the limited repertoire of international responses. We look for institutional effectiveness, therefore, by seeking impacts on political processes as an intermediary step toward improving environmental quality. This is not just a case of looking where the light is brighter. For international institutions to make a difference environmentally, they must spawn political change, and therefore it is appropriate to judge them according to how well they do so. 1 Environmental protection is a political activity.

We note that while the human population has increased by 23% and the world economy has grown 153%, the human footprint has increased by just 9%. Still, 75% the planet’s land surface is experiencing measurable human pressures. Moreover, pressures are perversely intense, widespread and rapidly intensifying in places with high biodiversity.

Until recently, most scientific assessments of such risks focused on the anatomy of conceivable environmental changes themselves, while devoting relatively little attention to the ecosystems and societies the changes might endanger. Recently, however, questions about the vulnerability of social and ecological systems are emerging as a central focus of policy-driven assessments of global environmental risks. Meeting the growing demand for a deeper and more useful understanding of vulnerability to global change will require a dual strategy in which initiatives targeted on immediate assessment needs and research opportunities complement and feed into a longer term program for enhancing relevant knowledge bases …</div></div></div>|Author|William C Clark and Edward A Parson|Year|2000|Publisher|Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John F.

INC chairman Jean Ripert of France broke the deadlock last May by drafting a compromise document that requires industrialized countries to develop national emission limits and emission inventories and to report periodically on their progress, without targets or dates.

The Z γ and Z γ γ production cross sections are measured with leptonic (e+ e−, μ+ μ−, ν ν) decays of the Z boson, in extended fiducial regions defined in terms of the lepton and photon acceptance. They are then compared to cross-section predictions from the Standard Model, where the sources of the photons are radiation off initial-state quarks and radiative Z-boson decay to charged leptons, and from fragmentation of final-state quarks and gluons into photons.

When they eventually land they can cause damage to crops, ecosystems, buildings, and human health. This phenomenon has been given the name ‘acid rain’, because often deposition occurs through mixing with precipitation, and because often the mechanism that does the damage is acidification. But ‘acid rain’has come to mean more than acid rain. The label is now used to cover the long-range transport of pollutants (whether or not deposition occurs through precipitation) that cause harm through mechanisms of either acidification or oxidization. The most important pollutants are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Both acid precipitation and long-range transport of air pollution were known long before acid rain became the subject of international controversy. The Scottish chemist Robert Angus Smith described acid rain as a consequence of high levels of coal burning in nineteenth-century England, publishing his accounts in an 1872 book (that coined the term). 1And Ibsen wrote of the foul air that travelled across the sea from Britain. But the contemporary understanding of acid rain is of more recent origin. It began in 1967, when Swedish chemist Svante Odén hypothesized that the increasing acidity in Swedish rivers and lakes was attributable to air pollution travelling from continental Europe and Britain. 2Odén called this ‘an insidious chemical war’, and warned that it would reduce fish populations, harm forests, increase plant diseases, and damage materials. 3 With …</div></div></div>|Author|Marc A Levy|Year|1970|Publisher|Oxford University Press|Citedby|78|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marc_Levy/publication/242676527_International_Co-operation_to_Combat_Acid_Rain/links/544f86d50cf29473161d892c/International-Co-operation-to-Combat-Acid-Rain.pdf', '|Title|Malaria stratification, climate, and epidemic early warning in Eritrea|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Eritrea has a successful malaria control program, but it is still susceptible to devastating malaria epidemics.

Relationships between monthly clinical malaria incidence by subzoba and monthly climate data from several sources, and with seasonal climate forecasts, were investigated.

In the early 1970s, no governments had policies in effect explicitly to reduce the emissions that lead to acid rain. Indeed, few even had scientific research programs under way to investigate the problem, and existing environmental policies to reduce ambient air pollution were probably contributing to a worsening of acid rain (through the increasing use of tall stacks). By 1980, new norms were emerging in the form of the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) in Europe and the 1980 Canada-US Memorandum of Intent (MOI). By 1991, emission reduction protocols had been concluded under the LRTAP convention, a new North American accord—the 1991 Canada-US Air Quality Agreement—had been signed, and most industrial countries had instituted acid rain control programs. New and stronger international environmental regimes had thus come into effect in both Europe and North America. 1</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">The aim of this chapter is to assess whether or not the development of two regimes, based on the 1979 LRTAP convention and the 1980 MOI, had a positive impact on the management of the acid rain problem during the 1980s, and, if so, how this impact was transmitted. The chapter begins with a brief description of the acid rain problem and the interests affected. It also lays out the policy and diplomatic responses, emphasizing the two regimes under study.</div></div></div>|Author|Don Munton and Marvin Soroos and Elena Nikitina and Marc A Levy|Year|1970|Publisher|MIT Press|Citedby|75|Eprint|', '|Title|Time for a third wave of environment and security scholarship?|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This is an enormously positive development, and scholars in two formerly quite segregated communities are now reading each other’s work and addressing common research questions.

The earliest environment-and-security writings in the 1980s were dominated by purple prose and bland bromides; articles were highly rhetorical, offering neither clear new definitions of security nor serious scholarship. Later, some writers made convincing arguments that a direct physical link exists between environment and US security, asserting that certain global environmental threats such as ozone depletion and climate change could harm the health or wellbeing of American citizens.

The most important implication is a need to explore the causes of regional conflict as an important end in itself, and to abandon the current fad of merely demonstrating links to environmental deterioration. The great progress in the research to date indicates that such a shift is possible.

As future missions extend beyond low-Earth orbit, analysis of returned environmental samples becomes impractical and safety monitoring should be performed in situ. Here, we describe initial designs of a five-channel tunable laser absorption spectrometer to continuously monitor combustion products with the goal of minimal maintenance and calibration over long-duration missions. The instrument incorporates dedicated laser channels to simultaneously target strong mid-infrared absorption lines of CO, HCl, HCN, HF, and CO2. The availability of low-power-consumption semiconductor lasers operating in the 2 to 5 μm wavelength range affords the flexibility to select absorption lines for each gas with maximum interaction strength and minimal interference from other gases, which enables the design of a compact and mechanically robust spectrometer with low-level sensitivity. In this paper, we focus primarily on absorption line selection based on the availability of low-power single-mode semiconductor laser sources designed specifically for the target wavelength range.</div></div>|Author|Ryan M Briggs and Clifford Frez and Carl E Borgentum and Mahmood Bagheri and Siamak Forouhar and Randy D May|Year|2014|Publisher|44th International Conference on Environmental Systems|Citedby|3|Eprint|https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/59623/ICES-2014-244.pdf%3Bsequence=1', '|Title|Portable 4.6 µm Laser Absorption Spectrometer for Carbon Monoxide Monitoring and Fire Detection|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">S part of the Advanced Exploration Systems Program, NASA supports the development of compact, lowpower fire detection platforms and environmental monitoring systems for the International Space Station and future missions, with the goal of tracking concentrations of particulates, acid gases, and other airborne hazards. 1 Within the Spacecraft Fire Safety Demonstration project, we have developed a laser absorption spectrometer operating at wavelengths near 4.6 µm that can be used to detect small concentrations of CO without interference from CO2, H2O, or other gases normally present in habitable environments.

One mechanism by which aerobic exercise may preserve executive function is through the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which also declines with age.

Participants were randomized to a stretching and toning control group or a moderate intensity walking intervention group. BDNF serum levels and performance on a task-switching paradigm were collected at baseline and follow-up. We found that age moderated the effect of intervention group on changes in BDNF levels, with those in the highest age quartile showing the greatest increase in BDNF after 1-year of moderate intensity walking exercise (p = .036). The mediation analyses revealed that BDNF mediated the effect of the intervention on task-switch accuracy, but did so as a function of age, such that exercise-induced changes in BDNF mediated the effect of exercise on task-switch performance only for individuals over the age of 71.

This study examined the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and recruitment of the neural circuits involved in an attentional control task in a group of healthy older adults. Employing a version of the Stroop task, we examined whether higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with an increase in activation in cortical regions responsible for imposing attentional control along with an up-regulation of activity in sensory brain regions that process task-relevant representations. Higher fitness levels were associated with better behavioral performance and an increase in the recruitment of prefrontal and parietal cortices in the most challenging condition, thus providing evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with an increase in the recruitment of the anterior processing regions. There was a top-down modulation of extrastriate visual areas that process both task-relevant and task-irrelevant attributes relative to the baseline. However, fitness was not associated with differential activation in the posterior processing regions, suggesting that fitness enhances attentional function by primarily influencing the neural circuitry of anterior cortical regions. This study provides novel evidence of a differential association of fitness with anterior and posterior brain regions, shedding further light onto the neural changes accompanying cardiorespiratory fitness.</div></div>|Author|Ruchika S Prakash and Michelle W Voss and Kirk I Erickson and Jason Lewis and Laura Chaddock and Edward Malkowski and Heloisa Alves and Jennifer S Kim and Amanda Szabo and Siobham White and Thomas Wojcicki and Arthur F Kramer and Emily L Mailey and Edward McAuley|Year|2011|Publisher|Frontiers|Citedby|110|Eprint|https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00229', '|Title|Growth trajectories of exercise self-efficacy in older adults: Influence of measures and initial status.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp""><h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Objective:</h3><div class=""gsh_csp""></div> This study examined differential trajectories of exercise-related self-efficacy beliefs across a 12-month randomized controlled exercise trial. <h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Method:</h3><div class=""gsh_csp""></div> Previously inactive older adults (N= 144; M age= 66.5) were randomly assigned to one of two exercise conditions (walking, flexibility-toning-balance) and completed measures of barriers self-efficacy (BARSE), exercise self-efficacy (EXSE), and self-efficacy for walking (SEW) across a 12-month period.

Several studies have postulated that increased regional brain volume and function are associated with aerobic fitness because of increased vascularization rather than increased neural tissue per se. We tested this position by examining the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and N‐acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the right frontal cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NAA is a nervous system specific metabolite found predominantly in cell bodies of neurons. We reasoned that if aerobic fitness was predominantly influencing the vasculature of the brain, then NAA levels should not vary as a function of aerobic fitness. However, if aerobic fitness influences the number or viability of neurons, then higher aerobic …</div></div></div>|Author|Kirk I Erickson and Andrea M Weinstein and Bradley P Sutton and Ruchika Shaurya Prakash and Michelle W Voss and Laura Chaddock and Amanda N Szabo and Emily L Mailey and Siobhan M White and Thomas R Wojcicki and Edward McAuley and Arthur F Kramer|Year|2012|Publisher|Blackwell Publishing Inc|Citedby|73|Eprint|https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/brb3.30', '|Title|Non-exercise estimated cardiorespiratory fitness: associations with brain structure, cognition, and memory complaints in older adults|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">There is increasing evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with brain structure and function, and improvements in CRF through exercise training have been associated with neural and cognitive functioning in older adults.

In neocortical areas, higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels are associated with increased gray matter volume, and these volumetric differences mediate enhanced cognitive performance in a variety of tasks. Here we examine whether cardiorespiratory fitness correlates with the volume of the subcortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia and whether this relationship predicts cognitive flexibility in older adults. Structural MRI was used to determine the volume of the basal ganglia nuclei in a group of older, neurologically healthy individuals (mean age 66 years, 𝑁=179). Measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), cognitive flexibility (task switching), and attentional control (flanker task) were also collected. Higher fitness levels were correlated with higher accuracy rates in the Task Switching paradigm. In addition, the volume of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus positively correlated with Task Switching accuracy. Nested regression modeling revealed that caudate nucleus volume was a significant mediator of the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness, and task switching performance. These findings indicate that higher cardiorespiratory fitness predicts better cognitive flexibility in older adults through greater grey matter volume in the dorsal striatum.</div></div>|Author|Timothy D Verstynen and Brighid Lynch and Destiny L Miller and Michelle W Voss and Ruchika Shaurya Prakash and Laura Chaddock and Chandramallika Basak and Amanda Szabo and Erin A Olson and Thomas R Wojcicki and Jason Fanning and Neha P Gothe and Edward McAuley and Arthur F Kramer and Kirk I Erickson|Year|1970|Publisher|Hindawi|Citedby|64|Eprint|http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2012/939285.pdf', '|Title|Cardiorespiratory fitness, hippocampal volume, and frequency of forgetting in older adults.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp""><h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Objective:</h3><div class=""gsh_csp""></div> The purpose of this study was to extend our earlier work to determine the extent to which cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with the frequency of memory problems via its effects on the hippocampus and spatial working memory.

The purpose of this study was to test the construct validity of a regression equation developed by Jurca and colleagues (2005) to estimate CRF without exercise testing in community dwelling older adults. Participants (n = 172) aged 60 to 80 years with no contraindications to submaximal or maximal exercise testing completed a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) and the submaximal Rockport 1-mile walk test on separate occasions. Data included in the regression equation (age, sex, body mass index, resting heart rate, and physical activity) were obtained via measurement or self-report. Participants also reported presence of cardiovascular conditions. The multiple R for the regression equation was .72, p &lt; .001 and CRF estimated from this equation was significantly correlated with the MET value from the GXT (r = 0.66) and with CRF estimated from submaximal field testing (r = 0.67). All three CRF indices were significantly and inversely associated with reporting more cardiovascular conditions.

Results Forty percent of trials reported significantly greater long-term weight loss with diet compared with aerobic exercise, while results for differences in weight regain were inconclusive. Diet+aerobic exercise resulted in significantly greater weight loss than diet alone in 50% of trials. However, weight regain (∼55% of loss) was similar in diet and diet+aerobic exercise groups.

Yet, the extent to which cardiorespiratory fitness-related brain activation is associated with better cognitive performance is not well understood. In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and executive function was mediated by greater prefrontal cortex activation in healthy older adults. Brain activation was measured during dual-task performance with functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 128 healthy older adults (59-80 years). Higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with greater activation during dual-task processing in several brain areas including the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex (ACC/SMA), thalamus and basal ganglia, right motor/somatosensory cortex and middle frontal gyrus, and left somatosensory cortex, controlling for age, sex, education, and gray matter volume. Of these regions, greater ACC/SMA activation mediated the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and dual-task performance.
