But these mechanisms matter, as responses to climate change could fundamentally differ depending on the contributions of life‐history plasticity vs. local adaptation to species‐wide climate tolerances. In particular, if local adaptation to climate is strong, populations across a species’ range—not only those at the trailing range edge—could decline sharply with global climate change.

Building from diversity–stability concepts in community ecology, within‐population diversity is gaining attention as an important component of population stability. Genetic and microhabitat variation within populations can generate diverse responses to common environmental fluctuations, dampening temporal variability across the population as a whole through portfolio effects. Yet, the potential for portfolio effects to operate at small scales within populations or to change with systematic environmental shifts, such as climate change, remain largely unexplored.

Trade‐offs observed among species may reflect pervasive constraints on phenotypes that are achievable given biophysical and resource limitations. If so, then among‐species trade‐offs should be consistent with trade‐offs within species. Alternatively, trait variation among co‐occurring species may reflect historical contingencies during community assembly rather than within‐species constraints. Here, we test whether a key trade‐off between relative growth rate (RGR) and water‐use efficiency (WUE) among Sonoran Desert winter annual plants is apparent within four species representing different strategies in the system.

Such “portfolio effects” have been increasingly documented at the scale of subpopulations and are thought to play an important role in generating stability of population phenomena in the face of environmental variation. However, few studies quantify the strength and origin of portfolio effects at the finer scale of individuals. We used 16 years of fruit production and climate data for an alpine plant to dissect the scale of portfolio effects in reproduction, as well as the contribution of individual traits including size and flowering time in driving reproductive output. Asynchrony in reproductive success substantially reduces variation in population‐level reproductive output, with ~ 1/4 of this stabilizing effect arising from individual differences …</div></div></div>|Author|Ellen Waddle and Lucas R Piedrahita and Elijah S Hall and Grace Kendziorski and William F Morris and Megan L Peterson and Daniel F Doak|Year|2019|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|', '|Title|Incorporating local adaptation into forecasts of species’ distribution and abundance under climate change|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Populations of many species are genetically adapted to local historical climate conditions.

The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade‐off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate.

We investigated relationships between flowering time, flowering synchrony, and reproductive success with local abiotic conditions and pollinator behavior.

Species generally arise in new environments through a combination of ecological divergence and spatial isolation. Under this framework, speciation occurs through three main processes: 1) niche expansion, 2) divergent selection, and 3) the accumulation of reproductive isolating mechanisms. In this dissertation, I tested specific hypotheses about the factors governing each of these stages, using a combination of stochastic simulations and field and greenhouse experiments with life history ecotypes of common monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus DC (Phrymaceae). First, I tested the ecological and genetic determinants of colonization success in flowering plants. In particular, I used stochastic simulations to test the effect of mating system plasticity on the persistence and adaptation of colonizing populations in new environments. I found that a shift to a mixed mating strategy facilitated niche expansion by reducing extinction and promoting adaptation under a broad range of colonization scenarios. In my second and third chapters, I examined the causes and consequences of life history divergence among populations of M. guttatus in central California. In chapter two, I used comparative demography to test for local adaptation and selection on life history traits in a common garden experiment in a montane perennial environment. I found that a perennial life history strategy had the highest performance and that selection favored perennial life history traits, although the native montane perennial ecotype was not locally adapted relative to other inland perennial …</div></div>|Author|Megan L Peterson|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2mt2289x/qt2mt2289x.pdf', '|Title|Use of Low Plasticity for Soil Liners and Covers|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Loess, which consists predominantly of low plasticity to non-plastic silt (PI≤ 10) with varying amounts of sand and clay-sized (-5 microns) material, covers much of north-central Oregon and eastern Washington. Several landfills operate in this area. Because of the lack of clayey soils and clayey bedrock in the region, loess was proposed for use as the low permeability soil barrier layer. Laboratory testing and large-scale field tests of test fills using SDRI\'s have shown that the remolded permeability of the loess is related to grain-size, soil gradation, and the percent saturation of the placed soil. We had an approximately 1: 1 correlation between the permeability results of laboratory remolded samples, undisturbed Shelby tube samples of test fills, and field SDRI tests. Data from six different sites have consistently shown that in order to achieve a permeability of less than 1x10-6 cm/s, the loess must contain greater than 70 percent minus US No. 200 sieve and have at least 15 percent minus 5 microns material.

Nearly 1,000 species of endemic drosophilids have evolved in situ in Hawaii since a single colonist arrived over 25 million years ago. A number of mechanisms, including ecological adaptation, sexual selection, and geographic isolation, have been proposed to explain the evolution of this hyperdiverse group of species. Here, we examine the known ecological associations of 326 species of endemic Hawaiian Drosophilidae in light of the phylogenetic relationships of these species. Our analysis suggests that the long-accepted belief of strict ecological specialization in this group does not hold for all taxa. While many species have a primary host plant family, females will also oviposit on non-preferred host plant taxa. Host shifting is fairly common in some groups, especially the grimshawi and modified mouthparts species groups of Drosophila, and the Scaptomyza subgenus Elmomyza. Associations with types of substrates (bark, leaves, flowers) are more evolutionarily conserved than associations with host plant families.

The Hawaiian Islands are often referred to as a ‘‘conveyor belt” archipelago (Carson and Clague, 1995); as the Pacific plate moves to the northwest over a stationary hotspot, islands are formed, carried with the plate, and gradually subside at a more-or-less constant rate (Price and Clague, 2002; Ziegler, 2002). This hotspot has been active for over 40 million years (Carson and Clague, 1995) and has resulted in a chain of successively older islands, seamounts, and atolls stretching northwest across the Pacific. Currently, there are eight ‘‘high islands” in the southeast of the chain that, at over 1000 m in elevation, are able to support a diverse flora and fauna. The youngest island, dated at less than 600,000 years old, is the Big Island of Hawai ‘i. Kaua ‘i, at about 5 million years old, is the oldest high island (Price and Clague, 2002). Extreme isolation, coupled with the unique geology and environmental conditions of the islands, has made Hawai ‘i a ‘‘natural laboratory” where the effects of evolution are readily observable (Kaneshiro, 1995). Over 850 endemic flowering plant (Wagner et al., 1990) and 4000 endemic insect species (Liebherr, 2001) are each thought to have been derived from about 200 colonization events. Colonist species can rapidly fill open ecological niches and diversify in situ, resulting in an amazing array of endemic fauna and flora. Newly emerging islands are then colonized from older source populations.

Nonetheless, the maintenance of adequate muscle mass, strength, and metabolic function has rarely, if ever, been targeted as a relevant endpoint of recommendations for dietary intake.

An association between regular physical activity and reduction of blood levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines is demonstrated in the literature pointing to an anti-inflammatory effect related to exercise. However, there is no consensus regarding which type of exercise and which parameters are the most appropriate to influence inflammatory markers. Evidence indicates that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can influence the synthesis of those cytokines affecting their production. The design of this study is a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between the cytokine genes SNP and the effect of physical activity on older women. The main outcomes are: serum levels of sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, measured by the ELISA method; genotyping of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF)-alpha (rs1800629), IL6 (rs1800795), IL10 (rs1800896) by the TaqMan Method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA); and physical performance assessed by Timed Up and Go and 10-Meter Walk Tests.

Na avaliação com Doppler contínuo, observou-se presença de som monofásico em artérias radial e ulnar. No teste do cicloergômetro, a dor isquêmica iniciou aos 2 minutos e 30 segundos e atingiu o ponto máximo aos 9 minutos e 26 segundos. Foi realizado tratamento em cicloergômetro três vezes por semana durante 8 semanas. Após o tratamento, o tempo de teste em cicloergômetro aumentou: dor inicial aos 5 minutos e 7 segundos e máxima aos 18 minutos. A paciente relatou desaparecimento da cianose e melhora na realização de atividades de vida diária. O protocolo de avaliação proposto envolvendo medidas objetivas (cicloergômetro) e subjetivas (questionário SF-36 traduzido e validado em português) foi bem tolerado, tendo sido capaz de detectar alterações no estado funcional da paciente.

Two experiments were conducted using psychophysical procedures to determine the relative contributions of alexithymia and autism to identity and expression recognition. Experiment 1 showed that alexithymia correlates strongly with the precision of expression attributions, whereas autism severity was unrelated to expression-recognition ability.

The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is a popular measure of ToM ability, validated in part by the poor performance of those with ASD. However, the RMET requires recognition of facial emotion, which is impaired in those with alexithymia, which frequently co-occurs with ASD. Thus, it is unclear whether the RMET indexes emotion recognition, associated with alexithymia, or ToM, associated with ASD. We therefore investigated the independent contributions of ASD and alexithymia to performance on the RMET.

While it was originally assumed that the interoceptive deficit in alexithymia is specific to emotion, recent evidence suggests that alexithymia may also be associated with difficulties perceiving some non-affective interoceptive signals, such as one\'s heart rate. It is therefore possible that the impairment experienced by those with alexithymia is common to all aspects of interoception, such as interpreting signals of hunger, arousal, proprioception, tiredness and temperature.

This study tested the hypothesis that where observed, emotion recognition deficits exhibited by patients with EDs are due to alexithymia, a co-occurring condition also associated with emotion recognition difficulties. Ability to recognize facial emotion was investigated in a sample of individuals with EDs and varying degrees of co-occurring alexithymia, and an alexithymia-matched control group.

In particular, we focus on the abilities to identify and to describe one’s own emotion, and consider how this ability may co-vary with, and even cause, difficulties in representing the other. We take an individual differences approach; the ability to identify and describe one’s own emotions varies considerably across individuals and this ability predicts the ability to recognize, represent and empathize with the emotions of others. Within the clinical domain, impairments in emotion recognition and empathy have been reported in numerous disorders, yet empirical findings have been equivocal. In autism, eating disorders, schizophrenia and many other clinical populations, mixed evidence concerning these abilities has produced an extremely inconsistent literature. Here, we consider whether alexithymia, associated with difficulties identifying and describing one’s own emotions, is responsible for the mixed empirical findings. Alexithymia is known to co-occur with several disorders associated with inconsistent reports of affective impairments, making it possible that this sub-clinical phenomenon may be responsible for emotion-related atypicalities across these disorders. The following discussion presents existing evidence for this alexithymia hypothesis, and highlights areas requiring further investigation. If supported, the alexithymia hypothesis provides evidence for the necessity of intact representations of one’s own emotions in representing those of other individuals.</div></div></div>|Author|Rebecca Brewer and Richard Cook and Geoffrey Bird|Year|2016|Publisher|Cambridge University Press|Citedby|5|Eprint|', '|Title|Parental relationships and emotional distress and well-being among college women|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Research suggests divorce can have significant effects on the emotional well-being of children and adolescents.

The Law Commission in England and Wales has proposed legal reform, as well as the utilisation of a defined psychiatric instrument to assist in fitness to plead assessments. Similar legal reforms are occurring in other jurisdictions. Our objective was to produce and validate a standardised assessment instrument of fitness to plead employing a filmed vignette of criminal proceedings.

In both paradigms, the oddball emotional expression was different from that of the base stream images. However, in the\'fixed-emotion\'paradigm, stimulus image varied at every presentation but the emotion in the base stream remained constant, and in the\'mixed-emotions\' paradigm, both stimulus image and emotion varied at every presentation, with only the oddball emotion (disgust) remaining constant.

The current study used purposely-developed stimuli depicting actors posing non-emotional internal states (satiety, pain, nausea, cold, fatigue, itch, and breathlessness) in a visual recognition task, in order to …</div></div></div>|Author|Rebecca Brewer and Jennifer McBride|Year|2018|Publisher|The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology|Citedby||Eprint|', '|Title|Brief Report: Typical Auditory-Motor and Enhanced Visual-Motor Temporal Synchronization in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">The perception of subsecond durations in adults with autism spectrum disorder (hereafter ‘autism’; n\u2009=\u200925 Experiment 1, n\u2009=\u200921 Experiment 2) and matched typical adults (n\u2009=\u200924 Experiment 1, n\u2009=\u200922 Experiment 2) was examined by requiring participants to perform an action in time with auditory (Experiment 1) or visual (Experiment 2) events.

In typical observers, integration processes may emerge in response to the covariation of facial and bodily expressions. However, it is widely thought that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) struggle to integrate information from disparate visual regions to form unitary percepts.

However, we claim that it is far from clear that these problems can or should be attributed to a new disorder. The empirical basis for a Gaming Disorder proposal, such as in the new ICD-11, suffers from fundamental issues. Our main concerns are the low quality of the research base, the fact that the current operationalization leans too heavily on substance use and gambling criteria, and the lack of consensus on symptomatology and assessment of problematic gaming. The act of formalizing this disorder, even as a proposal, has negative medical, scientific, public-health, societal, and human rights fallout that should be considered. Of particular concern are moral panics around the harm of video gaming.

Chain reactions caused by these tiny acts of participation form a growing part of collective action today, from neighborhood campaigns to global political movements. Political Turbulence reveals that, in fact, most attempts at collective action online do not succeed, but some give rise to huge mobilizations—even revolutions. Drawing on large-scale data generated from the Internet and real-world events, this book shows how mobilizations that succeed are unpredictable, unstable, and often unsustainable. To better understand this unruly new force in the political world, the authors use experiments that test how social media influence citizens deciding whether or not to participate. They show how different personality types react to social influences and identify which types of people are willing to participate at an early stage in a mobilization when there are few supporters or signals of viability. The authors argue that pluralism is the model of democracy that is emerging in the social media age—not the ordered, organized vision of early pluralists, but a chaotic, turbulent form of politics. This book demonstrates how data science and experimentation with social data can provide a methodological toolkit for understanding, shaping, and perhaps even predicting the outcomes of this democratic turbulence.</div></div>|Author|Helen Margetts and Peter John and Scott Hale and Taha Yasseri|Year|1970|Publisher|Princeton University Press|Citedby|165|Eprint|', '|Title|Petition Growth and Success Rates on the UK No. 10 Downing Street Website|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Now that so much of collective action takes place online, web-generated data can further understanding of the mechanics of Internet-based mobilisation.

Petition signing is an example of collective action which has gained in popularity with rising use of social media and provides such data for the whole population of petition signatories for a given platform. This paper tracks the growth curves of all 20,000 petitions to the UK government petitions website (                   http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk                                    ) and 1,800 petitions to the US White House site (                   https://petitions.whitehouse.gov                                    ), analyzing the rate of growth and outreach mechanism. Previous research has suggested the importance of the first day to the ultimate success of a petition, but has not examined early growth within that day, made possible here through hourly resolution in the data. The analysis shows that the vast majority of petitions do not achieve any measure of success; over 99 percent fail to get the 10,000 signatures required for an official response and only 0.1 percent attain the 100,000 required for a parliamentary debate (0.7 percent in the US). We analyze the data through a multiplicative process model framework to explain the heterogeneous growth of signatures at the population level. We define and measure an average outreach factor for petitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1% after 10 hours in the UK and 30 hours in the US). After a day or two, a petition’s fate is virtually set.

A research frontier is hence emerging which involves exploring the type of measures that can be drawn from data stores such as mobile phone logs, Internet searches and contributions to social media platforms and the extent to which these measures are accurate reflections of the wider population. This paper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which local commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter. It makes three contributions in particular. First, it shows that heuristics applied to geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting patterns; one which outperforms the current best method for estimating these patterns (the radiation model). This finding is of particular significance because we make use of relatively coarse geolocation data (at the city level) and use simple heuristics based on frequency counts. Second, it investigates sources of error in the proxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with higher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds that, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact that the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the population as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond simple frequency heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models.</div></div>|Author|Graham McNeill and Jonathan Bright and Scott A Hale|Year|2017|Publisher|SpringerOpen|Citedby|14|Eprint|https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0120-x', '|Title|Investigating political participation and social information using big data and a natural experiment|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Social information is particularly prominent in digital settings where the design of platforms can more easily give real-time information about the behaviour of peers and reference groups and thereby stimulate political activity. Changes to these platforms can generate natural experiments allowing an assessment of the impact of changes in social information and design on participation. This paper investigates the impact of the introduction of trending information on the homepage of the UK government petitions platform. Using interrupted time series and a regression discontinuity design, we find that the introduction of the trending feature had no statistically significant effect on the overall number of signatures per day, but that the distribution of signatures across petitions changes: the most popular petitions gain even more signatures at the expense of those with less signatories. We find significant differences between petitions trending at different ranks, even after controlling for each petition\'s individual growth prior to trending. The findings suggest a non-negligible group of individuals visit the homepage of the site looking for petitions to sign and therefore see the list of trending petitions, and a significant proportion of this group responds to the social information that it provides. These findings contribute to our understanding of how social information, and the form in which it is presented, affects individual political behaviour in digital settings.</div></div></div>|Author|Scott A Hale and Peter John and Helen Margetts and Taha Yasseri|Year|2014|Publisher||Citedby|14|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3562.pdf?utm_content=buffer8e405&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer', '|Title|Iterative 3-d pose correction and content-based image retrieval for dorsal fin recognition|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Contour or boundary descriptors may be used in content-based image retrieval to effectively identify appropriate images when image content consists primarily of a single object of interest.

We study multilingualism by collecting and analyzing a large dataset of the content written by multilingual editors of the English, German, and Spanish editions of Wikipedia. This dataset contains over two million paragraphs edited by over 15,000 multilingual users from July 8 to August 9, 2013.

Users primarily editing the Spanish and German editions make more complex edits than users who edit these editions as a second language. In contrast, users editing the English edition as a second language make edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit the English edition. In this way, English serves a special role bringing together content written by multilinguals from many language editions. Nonetheless, language remains a formidable hurdle to the spread of content: we find evidence for a complexity barrier whereby editors are less likely to edit complex content in a second language.

Websites change continually and a high level of flux makes it challenging to capture a snapshot of the web, or even a cross-section of a small subset of the web. A web archive, such as those at the Internet Archive, promises to store and deliver repeated cross-sections of the entire web, and it also offers the potential for longitudinal analysis. Whether this potential is realized depends on the extent to which the archive has truly captured the web. Therefore, a crucial question for Internet researchers is: ‘How good are the archival data?’ We ask if there are systematic biases in the Internet Archive, using a case study to address this question. Specifically, we are interested in whether biases exist in the British websites stored in the Internet Archive data. We find that the Internet Archive contains a surprisingly small subset, about 24%, of the webpages of the website that we use for our case study (the travel site, TripAdvisor). Furthermore, the subset of data we found in the Internet Archive appears to be biased and is not a random sample of the webpages on the site. The archived data we examine has a bias toward prominent webpages. This bias could create serious problems for research using archived websites.</div></div>|Author|Scott A Hale and Grant Blank and Victoria D Alexander|Year|2017|Publisher|UCL Press|Citedby|6|Eprint|http://research.gold.ac.uk/20698/1/Live%20versus%20Archive%20Chapter%20Final%20Typescript.pdf', '|Title|Explaining usage patterns in Open Government Data: the case of Data. gov. uk|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Open data is one of the most significant current trends in public administration, with over 100 current open government projects around the world investing considerable time and effort in opening up public sector information for free re-use.

Changes to these platforms can generate natural experiments allowing for an estimate of the impact of different kinds of social information on participation. This paper tests the hypothesis that social information shapes the distribution of political mobilizations by examining the introduction of trending information to the homepage of the UK government petition platform.

We address this deficit by analysing a novel panel dataset of political Twitter activity in the 2015 and 2017 elections in the United Kingdom. We find that Twitter based campaigning does seem to help win votes, a finding which is consistent across a variety of different model specifications including a first difference regression. The impact of Twitter use is small in absolute terms, though comparable with that of campaign spending.

Such identification is useful for biological studies of population, social interaction, migration, etc. The process whereby fin outlines are extracted in current fin-recognition software packages is manually intensive and represents a major user input bottleneck: it is both time consuming and visually fatiguing. This research aims to develop automated methods (employing unsupervised thresholding and morphological processing techniques) to extract cetacean dorsal fin outlines from digital photographs thereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will improve the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to correctly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space were examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable threshold could be easily identified. To assist with unsupervised thresholding, a new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures ("" pixelarity"") in an image after thresholding. The metric indicates how cleanly a threshold segments background and foreground elements and hence provides a good measure of the quality of a given threshold. This research results in successful extractions in roughly 93% of images, and significantly reduces user-input time.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.
