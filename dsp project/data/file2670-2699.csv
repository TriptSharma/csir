Almost all current programs for this task create or use explicit, abstract generalizations. These programs are largely ineffective for domains with weak or intractable theories. An exemplar-based approach is suitable for domains with inadequate theories but raises two additional problems: determining similarity and indexing exemplars. Our approach extends the exemplar-based approach with solutions to these problems. An implementation of our approach, called Protos, has been applied to the domain of clinical audiology. After reasonable training, Protos achieved a competence level equaling that of human experts and far surpassing that of other machine learning programs. Additionally, an “ablation study” has identified the aspects of Protos that are primarily responsible for its success.</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|Bruce W Porter and Ray Bareiss and Robert C Holte|Year|1990|Publisher|Elsevier|Citedby|395|Eprint|https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a248064.pdf', '|Title|Exemplar-based knowledge acquisition: A unified approach to concept representation, classification, and learning|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Exemplar-Based Knowledge Acquisition: A Unified Approach to Concept Representation, Classification, and Learning covers the fundamental issues in cognitive science and the technology for solving real problems.

The succeeding chapters discuss how the Protos approach meets the requirements of representing concepts, using them for classification, and acquiring them from available training. These chapters also deal with the design and implementation of Protos. These topics are followed by a presentation of examples of the application of Protos to audiology and evaluate its performance. The final chapters survey related work in the areas of case-based reasoning and automated knowledge acquisition and the contributions of Protos approach.

However, to be effectively remembered, a story must be told in a context that enables the hearer to index it functionally in memory. This occurs naturally when stories are told to students while they are attempting to perform the task being taught. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to engage students in a task while teaching it, so some other context must be found that facilitates appropriate indexing. We argue that this context occurs naturally in a teaching dialog, called an Aesopic dialog, in which the student asks questions and the expert answers with stories. In this dialog, the coherence of the conversation itself provides a context that enables the stories to be usefully incorporated into the student\'s memory. The widespread application of teaching through Aesopic dialogs requires overcoming the hurdle that experts are scarce and …</div></div></div>|Author|William Ferguson and Ray Bareiss and Lawrence Birnbaum and Richard Osgood|Year|1992|Publisher|Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|Citedby|179|Eprint|', '|Title|Exemplar-based knowledge acquisition|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Classification is fundamental to intelligent problem solving. By classifying a new entity, a problem solver can avoid much of the effort required for processing a unique occurrence. The problem solver\'s experience with similar entities could be brought to bear, and its limited computational resources conserved. Classification is the process of recognizing an entity as an instance of a known concept. A concept is the intensional representation of a class of entities that are equivalent with respect to the problem solver\'s goals and experience. An entity is classified by recognizing that its attributes imply that it is an instance of a particular concept strongly than they imply that it is an instance of any contrasting concept. To classify reliably, the problem solver must have an accurate representation of the correspondences between attributes and concepts. Reliable acquisition of concepts is the primary prerequisite for …</div></div></div>|Author|Ray Bareiss and B Chandrasekaran|Year|1970|Publisher|Academic Press|Citedby|133|Eprint|', '|Title|Practical methods for automatically generating typed links|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Our research concerns how to construct knowledge-rich hypermedia systems for use as aids to problem-solving. One of the most difficult steps in building such systems is constructing a fertile set of hypermedia links between the nodes they contain (ie, text segments, graphics, and video clips). This paper describes the progress we have made in formalizing and automating the process of creating typed links, that is links that not only join nodes, but also label the relationship between them. We present four different methods we have developed for automated linking, each of which uses a different scheme for representing nodes, and we evaluate each method by the criteria of recall, precision, thoroughness, and ease of use. Two of these methods, designed for two different user populations, are being incorporated into the ASKTool, a hypermedia editor currently in use at the Institute for the Learning Sciences.</div></div></div>|Author|Chip Cleary and Ray Bareiss|Year|1996|Publisher|ACM|Citedby|98|Eprint|', '|Title|Sickle cell counselor: A prototype goal-based scenario for instruction in a museum environment|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Goal-Based Scenarios (GBSs) provide a framework for the design of instruction—a framework in which the student plays a role within a simulation, acquiring knowledge and skills in the process of pursuing a meaningful goal within the simulation context.

In order to explore these issues, we have developed an architecture for using model-based task tracking to integrate organizational memories with performance support tools.

This has led to a major decrease in the abundance and biomass of a range of palatable plant species. Fox control has also started a trophic cascade that has resulted in a decline in the abundance of the greater glider (<i>Petauroides volans</i>) a folivorous arboreal marsupial, mediated either through increased predation by owls or increased competition with common brushtail possums (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>). We identified five potential scenarios for managing the effects of over-abundant swamp wallabies on the ecosystem as a whole.

Despite intensive research into various methods for achieving infertility, including immunocon‐traception and disrupting endocrine control of reproduction, researchers know little about the potential effects of these methods on the behavior of wild possums. We assessed the effects of surgically imposed sterility, either to block fertilization (tubal ligation) or to disrupt endocrine control of fertility (gonadectomy), by using radiotelemetry on the movement patterns and site fidelity of wild brushtail possums. In addition, we assessed the effect of gonadectomy on the transmission rate of a commonly occurring, directly transmitted pathogen in possums, <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> serovar <i>balcanica</i> (hereafter <i>L. balcanica</i>), to determine the effect of any behavioral changes …</div></div></div>|Author|Dave Ramsey|Year|2007|Publisher|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Citedby|31|Eprint|', '|Title|Factors influencing annual variation in breeding by common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">We assembled data on annual variation in breeding rates of brushtail possums from four long-term studies in the lower North Island of New Zealand, three of which spanned more than 20 years.

The overall breeding rate in 1996 at these sites was 28% (n = 201). Other instances of low breeding rate (&lt;70%) occurred asynchronously at particular sites. We analysed variation in breeding rates to determine the contributions to annual variation of individual condition (body weight), population density, food resources and other environmental predictors.

We present case studies for the house mouse, European rabbit, red fox and common brushtail possum and describe the current status of research into the use of VVIC as a broad-scale pest-management tool.

Whereas detection functions typically (e.g. for distance sampling) describe the probability of direct human observations of animal subjects, we adapted this approach for cryptic species where observation depends on animals being caught in traps. Specifically, we characterised the probability of individual brushtail possums being caught by leg-hold traps in an area of farmland and native forest in New Zealand. Detection probability was defined as the per-individual, per-trap, per-night probability of a possum being captured, and was modelled as a function of home-range utilisation.

These irruptions still occur despite extensive baiting campaigns. Most of the economic losses caused by rodents occur in cereal and oilseed crops, although significant damage occurs annually in both sugar cane and macadamia orchards. Currently, attempts to control rodent outbreaks rely heavily upon baiting with rodenticides. As these are normally applied in an emergency situation and without adequate scientific insight or planning, they are usually not cost effective. We present strategies aimed at reducing agricultural losses in the event of an outbreak that take into consideration important population processes such as: (a) the stage of development of the rodent population; (b) the likely course of population trends given prevailing environmental conditions; (c) the spatial …</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|David SL Ramsey and John C Wilson|Year|2000|Publisher|Elsevier|Citedby|28|Eprint|']"

This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2–like 1 (BCL-X L), which has shown clinical efficacy in some BCL-2–dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X L inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2–selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2–dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in …</div></div></div>|Author|Andrew J Souers and Joel D Leverson and Erwin R Boghaert and Scott L Ackler and Nathaniel D Catron and Jun Chen and Brian D Dayton and Hong Ding and Sari H Enschede and Wayne J Fairbrother and David CS Huang and Sarah G Hymowitz and Sha Jin and Seong Lin Khaw and Peter J Kovar and Lloyd T Lam and Jackie Lee and Heather L Maecker and Kennan C Marsh and Kylie D Mason and Michael J Mitten and Paul M Nimmer and Anatol Oleksijew and Chang H Park and Cheol-Min Park and Darren C Phillips and Andrew W Roberts and Deepak Sampath and John F Seymour and Morey L Smith and Gerard M Sullivan and Stephen K Tahir and Chris Tse and Michael D Wendt and Yu Xiao and John C Xue and Haichao Zhang and Rod A Humerickhouse and Saul H Rosenberg and Steven W Elmore|Year|2013|Publisher|Nature Publishing Group|Citedby|1374|Eprint|', '|Title|Comparative genomics of the lactic acid bacteria|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Lactic acid-producing bacteria are associated with various plant and animal niches and play a key role in the production of fermented foods and beverages. We report nine genome sequences representing the phylogenetic and functional diversity of these bacteria. The small genomes of lactic acid bacteria encode a broad repertoire of transporters for efficient carbon and nitrogen acquisition from the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit and reflect a limited range of biosynthetic capabilities that indicate both prototrophic and auxotrophic strains. Phylogenetic analyses, comparison of gene content across the group, and reconstruction of ancestral gene sets indicate a combination of extensive gene loss and key gene acquisitions via horizontal gene transfer during the coevolution of lactic acid bacteria with their habitats.</div></div></div>|Author|K Makarova and A Slesarev and Y Wolf and A Sorokin and B Mirkin and E Koonin and A Pavlov and N Pavlova and V Karamychev and N Polouchine and V Shakhova and I Grigoriev and Y Lou and D Rohksar and S Lucas and K Huang and DM Goodstein and T Hawkins and V Plengvidhya and D Welker and J Hughes and Y Goh and A Benson and K Baldwin and J-H Lee and I Diaz-Muniz and B Dosti and V Smeianov and W Wechter and R Barabote and G Lorca and E Altermann and R Barrangou and B Ganesan and Y Xie and H Rawsthorne and D Tamir and C Parker and F Breidt and J Broadbent and R Hutkins and D O\'sullivan and J Steele and G Unlu and M Saier and T Klaenhammer and P Richardson and S Kozyavkin and B Weimer and D Mills|Year|2006|Publisher|National Academy of Sciences|Citedby|1180|Eprint|https://www.pnas.org/content/103/42/15611', '|Title|Meta-analysis identifies 29 additional ulcerative colitis risk loci, increasing the number of confirmed associations to 47|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies in ulcerative colitis have identified 18 susceptibility loci. We conducted a meta-analysis of six ulcerative colitis genome-wide association study datasets, comprising 6,687 cases and 19,718 controls, and followed up the top association signals in 9,628 cases and 12,917 controls. We identified 29 additional risk loci (P&lt; 5× 10− 8), increasing the number of ulcerative colitis–associated loci to 47. After annotating associated regions using GRAIL, expression quantitative trait loci data and correlations with non-synonymous SNPs, we identified many candidate genes that provide potentially important insights into disease pathogenesis, including IL1R2, IL8RA-IL8RB, IL7R, IL12B, DAP, PRDM1, JAK2, IRF5, GNA12 and LSP1. The total number of confirmed inflammatory bowel disease risk loci is now 99, including a minimum of 28 shared association signals …</div></div></div>|Author|Carl A Anderson and Gabrielle Boucher and Charlie W Lees and Andre Franke and Mauro D\'Amato and Kent D Taylor and James C Lee and Philippe Goyette and Marcin Imielinski and Anna Latiano and Caroline Lagacé and Regan Scott and Leila Amininejad and Suzannah Bumpstead and Leonard Baidoo and Robert N Baldassano and Murray Barclay and Theodore M Bayless and Stephan Brand and Carsten Büning and Jean-Frédéric Colombel and Lee A Denson and Martine De Vos and Marla Dubinsky and Cathryn Edwards and David Ellinghaus and Rudolf SN Fehrmann and James AB Floyd and Timothy Florin and Denis Franchimont and Lude Franke and Michel Georges and Jürgen Glas and Nicole L Glazer and Stephen L Guthery and Talin Haritunians and Nicholas K Hayward and Jean-Pierre Hugot and Gilles Jobin and Debby Laukens and Ian Lawrance and Marc Lémann and Arie Levine and Cecile Libioulle and Edouard Louis and Dermot P McGovern and Monica Milla and Grant W Montgomery and Katherine I Morley and Craig Mowat and Aylwin Ng and William Newman and Roel A Ophoff and Laura Papi and Orazio Palmieri and Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet and Julián Panés and Anne Phillips and Natalie J Prescott and Deborah D Proctor and Rebecca Roberts and Richard Russell and Paul Rutgeerts and Jeremy Sanderson and Miquel Sans and Philip Schumm and Frank Seibold and Yashoda Sharma and Lisa A Simms and Mark Seielstad and A Hillary Steinhart and Stephan R Targan and Leonard H Van Den Berg and Morten Vatn and Hein Verspaget and Thomas Walters and Cisca Wijmenga and David C Wilson and Harm-Jan Westra and Ramnik J Xavier and Zhen Z Zhao and Cyriel Y Ponsioen and Vibeke Andersen and Leif Torkvist and Maria Gazouli and Nicholas P Anagnou and Tom H Karlsen and Limas Kupcinskas and Jurgita Sventoraityte and John C Mansfield and Subra Kugathasan and Mark S Silverberg and Jonas Halfvarson and Jerome I Rotter and Christopher G Mathew and Anne M Griffiths and Richard Gearry and Tariq Ahmad and Steven R Brant and Mathias Chamaillard and Jack Satsangi and Judy H Cho and Stefan Schreiber and Mark J Daly and Jeffrey C Barrett and Miles Parkes and Vito Annese and Hakon Hakonarson and Graham Radford-Smith and Richard H Duerr and Séverine Vermeire and Rinse K Weersma and John D Rioux|Year|2011|Publisher|Nature Publishing Group|Citedby|1135|Eprint|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3084597/', '|Title|Event generator tunes obtained from underlying event and multiparton scattering measurements|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">New sets of parameters (“tunes”) for the underlying-event (UE) modelling of the <span class=""gs_fscp"">pythia</span>8, <span class=""gs_fscp"">pythia6</span> and <span class=""gs_fscp"">herwig++</span> Monte Carlo event generators are constructed using different parton distribution functions.

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.6 (19.7) fb− 1 for the dimuon (dielectron) channel. No evidence for non-standard-model physics is observed and 95% confidence level limits are set on parameters from a number of new physics models. The narrow resonance analyses exclude a Sequential Standard Model Z SSM′ resonance lighter than 2.90 TeV, a superstring-inspired Z ψ′ lighter than 2.57 TeV, and Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein gravitons with masses below 2.73, 2.35, and 1.27 TeV for couplings of 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.

Recent substantive applications include Hamilton (1988)(interest rates), Hamilton (1989)(aggregate output), Cecchetti, Lam and Mark (1990) and Abel (1992)(stock returns), and Engel and Hamilton (1990)(exchange rates), among many others. Our attention here focuses on Hamilton\'s Markov switching model, which has become very popular. In Hamilton\'s model, time-series dynamics are governed by a finite-dimensional parameter vector, which switches (potentially each period) depending upon which of two states is realised, with state transitions governed by a first-order Markov process with constant transition probabilities. Although the popularity of Hamilton\'s model is well deserved, it nevertheless incorporates a potentially severely binding constraint, the constancy of state transition probabilities. Economic considerations suggest the desirability of allowing the transition probabilities to vary. As an example, consider the process of exchange rate revaluation. It is plausible that the likelihood of exchange rate revaluation increases under progressively more severe over-or undervaluation on the basis of economic fundamentals, and certainly, one would not want to exclude that possibility from the outset.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">\'Financial support from the UK Economic and Social Research Council under grant R000233447 is gratefully acknowledged by both authors.

Data are collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The distribution of transverse momentum (p T) surrounding dijet systems is measured by selecting charged particles in different ranges of p T and at different angular cones of pseudorapidity and azimuth. The measurement is performed as a function of centrality of the PbPb collisions, the p T asymmetry of the jets in the dijet pair, and the distance parameter R used in the anti-k T jet clustering algorithm. In events with unbalanced dijets, PbPb collisions show an enhanced multiplicity in the hemisphere of the subleading jet, with the p T imbalance compensated by an excess of low-p T particles at large angles from the jet axes.</div></div>|Author|Vardan Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and W Adam and E Asilar and T Bergauer and J Brandstetter and E Brondolin and M Dragicevic and J Erö and M Flechl and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and C Hartl and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and V Knünz and A König and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and T Matsushita and I Mikulec and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and H Rohringer and J Schieck and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and W Treberer-Treberspurg and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and S Alderweireldt and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and A Knutsson and J Lauwers and S Luyckx and M Van De Klundert and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and A Van Spilbeeck and S Abu Zeid and F Blekman and J D’Hondt and N Daci and I De Bruyn and K Deroover and N Heracleous and J Keaveney and S Lowette and L Moreels and A Olbrechts and Q Python and D Strom and S Tavernier and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Van Parijs and P Barria and H Brun and C Caillol and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and G Fasanella and L Favart and A Grebenyuk and G Karapostoli and T Lenzi and A Léonard and T Maerschalk and Andrey Marinov and L Perniè and A Randle-Conde and T Seva and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and R Yonamine and F Zenoni and F Zhang and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and S Crucy and Didar Dobur and Alexis Fagot and Guillaume Garcia and Muhammad Gul and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Deniz Poyraz and Dirk Ryckbosch and Sinem Salva and Michael Sigamani and Michael Tytgat and Ward Van Driessche and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and O Bondu and S Brochet and G Bruno and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and A Jafari and P Jez and M Komm and V Lemaitre and A Mertens and M Musich and C Nuttens and L Perrini and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and N Beliy and GH Hammad and WL Aldá Júnior and FL Alves and GA Alves and L Brito and M Correa Martins Junior and M Hamer and C Hensel and C Mora Herrera and A Moraes and ME Pol and P Rebello Teles and E Belchior Batista Das Chagas and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custódio and EM Da Costa|Year|2016|Publisher|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Citedby|463|Eprint|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP01(2016)006', '|Title|Measurement of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections in proton-proton collisions at  = 7 TeV|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">A bstract Measurements of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections are presented using an integrated luminosity of 4.5 (4.8) fb− 1 in the dimuon (dielectron) channel of proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at s= 7 TeV.

In addition, the reliability and validity of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS) was demonstrated.   Methods A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including SAS, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (Y-scale), visual analogue scale (VAS), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of DSM-IV. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26.06; SD = 5.96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of SAS.   Results Based on the factor analysis results, the subscale “disturbance of reality testing” was removed, and six factors were left. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified (Cronbach\'s alpha = 0.967). SAS and its subscales were significantly correlated with K-scale and Y-scale. The VAS of each factor also showed a significant correlation with each subscale. In addition, differences were found in the job (p&lt;0.05), education (p&lt;0.05), and self-reported smartphone addiction scores (p&lt;0.001) in SAS.   Conclusions This study developed the first scale of the smartphone addiction aspect of the diagnostic manual.

The 40S subunit first binds eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 3 and an eIF2–GTP–initiator transfer RNA ternary complex. The resulting complex requires eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4F to bind to a messenger RNA and to scan to the initiation codon 2. eIF5 stimulates hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and eIF2 is released from the 48S complex formed at the initiation codon before it is joined by a 60S subunit to form an active 80S ribosome 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

The authors use a sample of 87 matched dyads from two-party IJVs formed in Kazakhstan to examine the influence of knowledge transfer between IJV partners on commitment and resulting satisfaction.

We argue that the existing trust between organizations not only survives tough and shifting times, but also helps steer those organizations through such trying periods. We investigated a context where a major change was instituted in a cooperative marketing channel. Here, the supplier (the focal channel member) had to convince the other channel members (the retailers) about the impending merger, which may or may not bring benefits to all.

This study develops hypotheses built upon theory to determine how organizational identification impacts the relationship between the evaluation of a firm\'s performance by another firm and key relational variables. This research investigates the impact of the evaluation of exchange performance on key relational and outcome constructs in a variety of different ways. First, the nature of the relationship between the evaluations of performance and outcome variables is assessed for potential curvilinear effects. Second, the incremental effects of the impact of the exchange performance on outcome variables are assessed. Third, this study incorporates responses of the performance of exchange of products and services at the attribute level. Fourth, while studies have incorporated some of the above characteristics, none have incorporated these on the inter-organizational level, the context of the setting here.

Intrusive rocks are inferred to represent the solidified remnants of a plumbing system that fed eruptions at the surface, as well as themselves representing substantial accumulations of magma in the subsurface. The vast majority of intrusive rock within the upper crust is in widespread sills, the emplacement of which may structurally isolate and dismember upper crustal strata from underlying basement, as well as spawning dyke assemblages of complex geometry. Interaction of dykes and shoaling sills with near-surface aquifers is implicated in development of mafic volcaniclastic deposits which, in better-studied provinces, comprise large vent complexes and substantial primary volcaniclastic deposits. Flood lavas generally postdate and overlie mafic volcaniclastic deposits, and are emplaced as pahoehoe flows at a grand scale (up to 104km2) from eruptions lasting years to decades. As with modern Hawaiian analogues, pahoehoe flood lavas have erupted from fissure vents that sometimes show evidence of high lava fountains at times during eruption.

The Whitsunday Silicic LIP event had widespread impact, producing both substantial extrusive volumes of dominantly silicic pyroclastic material and coeval first-cycle volcanogenic sediment that accumulated within many eastern Australian sedimentary basins, and principally in the Great Australian Basin system (&gt;2 Mkm3 combined volume).

The Zigzag wingbox consists of a rigid part and a morphing part. The rigid part is a semi-monocoque construction that houses the fuel tank and transfers the aerodynamic loads from the morphing part to the fuselage. The morphing part consists of various morphing partitions where in each partition there are two spars each consisting of two beams hinged together. Each morphing partition is covered by flexible skin and is bounded by two ribs through which the spars are connected. The ribs transfer the loads between the spars of adjacent morphing partitions and serves as the main structure to which the flexible skins are to be attached.

Operating under high pressure, hydraulic pistons are capable of producing large, sustainable control forces, but disadvantages include the weight penalty of the bulky actuator components, dense operating fluid, and extensive plumbing.

Human performance over short periods of time was studied to characterize the power available, and the transmission was designed to deliver as much of this power as possible to the rotors. The addition of a hand-cranking mechanism was shown to increase pilot power output by 20% for the intended 60 second duration. The quad-rotor configuration was continued in Gamera II because it was shown to provide passive stability in ground effect. Innovative lightweight structural concepts were developed, which helped reduce vehicle empty weight by 33% to 32.3 kg (71 lb). The rotors were designed using a comprehensive optimization process that coupled aerodynamics, blade spar stiffness, and airframe weight models to yield the lowest possible vehicle power required.

In one sense of the term, argument refers to a verbal dispute in which two or more people maintain what they construe to be incompatible positions regarding an assertion or belief. Moreover, participants mutually attribute argumentative intentions to each other. That is, the parties assume that their assertions are incompatible and that the main goals for each arguer is to win—that is, to arrive at an end state where his or her viewpoint prevails. Thus, winning here means being able to proceed unencumbered in an attempt to maintain a position or to pursue a course of action. The primary plan of attack in this type of argument is to remove any obstacle that stands in the way of one\'s success. If physical force and coercion are necessary, then these serve as appropriate means of goal attainment. If persuasion, either by appeal or by threat, works, then this will be perceived as legitimate. The important point in a disputative argument is that almost any plan that facilitates and supports the desired position will be used. All other goals are subservient to the primary one of winning. A second definition of argument emerges from the study of philosophy, logic, and rhetoric. Here, argument is defined as a form of verbal discourse in which a position, claim, or belief is asserted, and then reasons are given to substantiate this assertion. By substantiation, we mean that an arguer uses reasons as evidence for supporting an assertion and persuading others to accept it. Reasons may be evaluated according to certain criteria, including logical coherence.

In either case, flexibility exists within the system to adapt to changing circumstances, but his distinction centers on who is in charge of that flexibility. For Opperman, an adaptable system is one in which the flexible control of information or system performance automation resides in the hands of the user; s/he must explicitly command, generally at run time, the changes which ensue. In an adaptive system, by contrast, the flexibility in information or automation behavior is controlled by the system. It is as if Opperman is implying (though not explicitly defining) a kind of “metaautomation” which is present and in control of the degrees of freedom and flexibility in information and performance automation subsystems in an adaptive system, but which is absent (and is replaced by human activities) in an adaptable one. It is unclear whether the Augmented Cognition community consistently uses Opperman’s terms or makes his distinction, but it would seem that, in the majority of cases at least, when the phrases “adaptive system”,“adaptive user interface” and “adaptive automation” are used in this community, they are used in Opperman’s sense of a machine system which controls flexibility in information and performance subsystems, albeit in the service of the human.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Adaptive systems tend to have some distinct advantages over adaptable ones in terms of their impact on human+ machine system decision making, and these advantages make them useful in a wide range of military and commercial contexts.

We are developing an approach to UAV control that addresses these challenges. We use the metaphor of a sports team’s playbook to enable both quick and complex, variable-initiative control of a variety of UAVs—the user of our Playbook “calls a play” which need not (but may, if the user desires) specify what type or how many UAVs should be used to satisfy it.

This definition emphasizes the nature of trust as an attitude toward the uncertain future actions of an agent. Some important implications of this definition for adaptive automation systems are discussed including (a) trust is not synonymous with user acceptance; in fact, trust should be tuned to result in accurate usage decisions by operators,(b) trust becomes more important with complex, adaptive automation precisely because it becomes less plausible for a human operator to fully understand what and how the automation will operate in all contents, and (c) as an attitude, trust is produced and affected by methods other than rational cognition. In fact, Lee and See provide a model with three methods of tuning trust—analytic, analogic and affective—with special emphasis on their roles trust for adaptive automation. Of these, we argue that the latter two will be more important in human interaction with adaptive automation than they are with traditional automation. We define and discuss a method of tuning analogic and affective trust: the “etiquette” of human interaction with automation.

Caregiver burnout is one of the top reasons for the transition from independent living to costly nursing homes or other care-giving facilities. As a result, technologists are rushing to find tools that can assist caregivers and augment the elder’s ability to age in place. For a generation whose introduction to technology includes the black and white television, where the metaphors of windows and desktops are not automatically understood, the blitz of PDAs, smart homes, and voice recognition systems can be confusing, intimidating and stressful. Add to this the elder’s need for companionship to ward off isolation and dementia, and the design problem transpires to a much bigger challenge than designing around physical limitations of the elderly. The idea of companionship provided by technology is not new. From the simple rule-based Tamagotchi pets to Sony’s sophisticated AIBO, there is a large body of evidence that shows that the owners of these robotic pets form genuine and meaningful emotional bonds. However, few solutions combine ‘purposeful utility’with entertainment and companionship. Solutions that are ‘purposeful’are predictable and seldom achieve the level of autonomy that captures the interest of and engages the user, while solutions with high entertainment value often lack functions that directly aid the elder with daily functions.

To date, such models have been achieved via the scripting of specific trajectories of behaviors or, in limited instances, through very complex,“first principles” psychological models of agent motivation and goal-based behaviors. Neither of these is entirely appropriate for the production of a large series of rich and deep social interactions. We have developed a quantitative, computational implementation of a rich, universal theory of human-human “politeness” behaviors and the culture-specific interpretive frameworks for them (labeled “etiquette”) from sociology, linguistics and anthropology. This model links observable and inferred aspects of power and familiarity relationships, the degree of imposition of an act (each of which have implications for roles and intents) and the actor’s character to produce expectations about politeness behaviors. We have recently demonstrated the ability for this algorithm to produce culture-specific, politeness-appropriate utterances and perceptions of utterances in a game setting. Furthermore, our algorithmic approach to calculating culturespecific attitudes offered distinct advantages over alternate methods of producing such behaviors.

Past theories of mountain climbing, and other adventurous leisure activities, have predominantly focused on uncovering the motives for participation; and risk has been posited as a primary attraction. A number of studies have concluded that identity and meaning are factors related to participation. However, none to date have examined the dynamics by which these factors are constructed and maintained in the lives of participants. This thesis places meaning and self or identity at the centre of its enquiry into how New Zealand mountaineers sustain their commitment to an adventurous leisure activity. Thus, it seeks to address the current lack of knowledge regarding the way in which activities such as mountain climbing can contribute to participants\'  sense of who they are and what their lives are about. A biographical narrative approach was adopted to achieve this central aim as, it is argued, self and meaning are constructed through the stories told about life experiences. Narrative interviews were conducted with twenty-two committed New Zealand mountaineers; and supporting materials were collected from publications and other relevant sources. The interpretation of the research material was facilitated by theories of the interrelationship between narrative, meaning and self, and the implications of current social conditions for their construction. By applying a narrative approach to the study of mountaineers for the first time, this thesis sheds new light on our understanding of mountaineering.

White clover (<i>Trifolium repens</i>) and red clover (<i>Trifolium pratense</i>) are dominant in specific regions and farm systems. Although breeding progress for disease and insect resistance has been achieved, these crops have shown lower rates of genetic gain for yield than major grain crops, owing to lower breeding investment, longer selection cycles, impossibility to capitalize on harvest index, outbreeding mating systems associated with severe inbreeding depression, and high interaction of genotypes with cropping conditions and crop utilizations.

Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r2 = 0.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum.

The transcriptomes of 27 alfalfa genotypes, including elite breeding genotypes, parents of mapping populations, and unimproved wild genotypes, were sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. De novo assembly of quality-filtered 72-bp reads generated 25,183 contigs with a total length of 26.8 Mbp and an average length of 1,065 bp, with an average read depth of 55.9-fold for each genotype.

Additional markers identified on chromosomes 1 and 8 located the regions where no Verticillium resistance locus has been reported. This study highlights the value of SNP genotyping by high resolution melting to identify the disease resistance loci in tetraploid alfalfa. With further validation, the markers identified in this study could be used for improving resistance to Verticillium wilt in alfalfa breeding programs.</div></div>|Author|Tiejun Zhang and Long-Xi Yu and Per McCord and David Miller and Suresh Bhamidimarri and David Johnson and Maria J Monteros and Julie Ho and Peter Reisen and Deborah A Samac|Year|2014|Publisher|Public Library of Science|Citedby|8|Eprint|https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115953', '|Title|Leaf trait coloration in white clover and molecular mapping of the red midrib and leaflet number traits|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is a highly outcrossing heterozygous allotetraploid species, for which classic inheritance studies have been inconclusive. With the aid of molecular markers, it is now possible to study the genes controlling morphological traits. The objectives of this study were to catalog the leaf marks in white clover and map the location of leaf morphological traits based on cosegregation with molecular markers. A mapping population segregating for eight morphological traits consisting of leaf marks and number of leaflets was developed and phenotyped at two different locations during the summer and winter seasons. A confirmation population, derived by selfing one of the mapping population parents, was produced and phenotyped in one location at two different times of the year. Through the use of previously published simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker maps, linkages between the mapped …</div></div></div>|Author|Rebecca M Tashiro and Yuanhong Han and María J Monteros and Joseph H Bouton and Wayne A Parrott|Year|2010|Publisher|Crop Science Society of America|Citedby|8|Eprint|https://parrottlab.uga.edu/parrottlab/Publications/Tashiroetal2010.pdf', '|Title|QTL mapping of aluminum tolerance in tetraploid alfalfa|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Aluminum (Al) toxicity in acid soils is one of the factors limiting crop production. Alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) is one of the most important forage legumes worldwide and is susceptible to Al toxicity. Al tolerance in alfalfa was identified in a diploid <i>Medicago sativa</i> subs<i>. caerulea</i> accession (Sledge et al., 2002) and has been successfully integrated at the tetraploid level in the Al-tolerant genotype Altet-4. The goals of this study are to identify and confirm quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Al-tolerance in tetraploid alfalfa. Two populations of at least 190 individuals each were developed from crosses between Altet-4 (Al-tolerant) and the Al-susceptible genotypes 95-608 derived from CUF-101, and NECS141, a semi-dormant breeding line developed in Iowa. The parental lines and the progeny from the mapping populations were screened using a callus bioassay and a whole plant assay.

Drought is one of the most important factors limiting yield in crop plants, including alfalfa. Drought tolerance mechanisms are genetically and physiologically complex indicating a quantitative inheritance (Valliyodan et al., 2006). The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with yield under drought stress and to develop and map molecular markers derived from transcription factor genes sequences previously implicated in drought tolerance.</div></div></div>|Author|Ian M Ray and Mary K Sledge and Joseph H Bouton and Maria J Monteros|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|5|Eprint|', '|Title|Genetics, genomics and breeding of forage crops|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Forage crops include several species of grasses and legumes that are widely used as animal fodder in the form of hay, pasturage and silage, as well as for turf and erosion control.
