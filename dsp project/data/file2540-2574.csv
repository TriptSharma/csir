Here we introduce three previously uncharacterized, nondirection-selective ON–OFF RGC types that represent a distinct set of feature detectors in the mouse retina. The three high-definition (HD) RGCs possess small receptive-field centers and strong surround suppression. They respond selectively to objects of specific sizes, speeds, and types of motion. We present comprehensive morphological characterization of the HD RGCs and physiological recordings of their light responses, receptive-field size and structure, and synaptic mechanisms of surround suppression.

Here, we identify a circuit where inhibition from a specific amacrine cell plays a vital role in shaping the feature selectivity of a postsynaptic ganglion cell. We record from transgenically labeled CRH-1 amacrine cells and identify a postsynaptic target for CRH-1 amacrine cell inhibition in an atypical retinal ganglion cell (RGC) in mouse retina, the Suppressed-by-Contrast (SbC) RGC. Unlike other RGC types, SbC RGCs spike tonically in steady illumination and are suppressed by both increases and decreases in illumination.

Here we report a novel extracellular acidification mechanism mediated by glial cells in the retina. Using self-referencing H+-selective microelectrodes to measure extracellular H+ fluxes, we show that activation of retinal Müller (glial) cells of the tiger salamander by micromolar concentrations of extracellular ATP induces a pronounced extracellular H+ flux independent of bicarbonate transport. ADP, UTP and the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγs at micromolar concentrations were also potent stimulators of extracellular H+ fluxes, but adenosine was not. The extracellular H+ fluxes induced by ATP were mimicked by the P2Y1 agonist MRS 2365 and were significantly reduced by the P2 receptor blockers suramin and PPADS, suggesting activation of P2Y receptors. Bath-applied ATP induced an intracellular rise in calcium in Müller cells; both the calcium rise and the extracellular H+ fluxes were significantly attenuated when calcium re-loading into the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by thapsigargin and when the PLC-IP3 signaling pathway was disrupted with 2-APB and U73122. The anion transport inhibitor DIDS also markedly reduced the ATP-induced increase in H+ flux while SITS had no effect. ATP-induced H+ fluxes were also observed from Müller cells isolated from human, rat, monkey, skate and lamprey retinae, suggesting a highly evolutionarily conserved mechanism of potential general importance.

The effects of the neuromodulator nitric oxide (NO) have been studied in many circuits, including in the vertebrate retina, where it regulates synaptic release, gap junction coupling, and blood vessel dilation, but little is known about the cells that release NO. We show that a single type of amacrine cell (AC) controls NO release in the inner retina, and we report its light responses, electrical properties, and calcium dynamics. We discover that this AC forms a dense gap junction network and that the strength of electrical coupling in the network is regulated by light through NO.

Suppressed-by-Contrast (SbC) neurons represent a less well-known fourth category; they decrease firing below a baseline rate for both positive and negative contrasts.

The fact that the retina presents a self-contained sensory circuit (not receiving any neuronal inputs from other sensory or brain regions) makes it an ideal preparation not just for interrogating visual processing in the retina itself, but also for understanding general principles of signal processing and neural computations performed throughout the nervous system.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">One of the key advantages of the retina as a model circuit is the ease with which physiological stimuli can be applied to tissue explants. Such explants contain the primary sensory cells (photoreceptors), fully intact downstream circuitry, and at the final stage, output cells of the retina (retinal ganglion cells; RGCs) whose axon projections leave the retina and transmit processed information to higher brain regions. Thus, it is possible to project visual stimuli directly onto the explant and obtain fully physiological responses to this stimulation, including the processing steps within the retinal circuitry and patterns of retinal output in the form of action potentials. One of the advantages of visual stimuli is that the stimulation parameters (pattern, timing, wavelength, location) can be controlled very precisely by the experimenter. In addition, the nature of the actual stimulus can also be defined for assessing the processing of different stimulus properties (eg motion, size, contrast, spatial frequency).</div></div></div>|Author|Christian Wilms and Jason Jacoby and Greg Schwartz|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Wilms/publication/309397575_Visual_Stimulation_of_Retinal_Explants_on_a_Standard_Multiphoton_Microscope/links/580e301008aef766ef10c7f1/Visual-Stimulation-of-Retinal-Explants-on-a-Standard-Multiphoton-Microscope.pdf', '|Title|Extracellular pH Dynamics of Isolated Retinal Horizontal Cells|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Lateral inhibition is a fundamental building block of neuronal processing. Despite the passage of over sixty years, the precise molecular mechanism(s) that generates lateral inhibition in the outer retina is still unknown and contentiously debated. Surprisingly, two separate papers using two different techniques were published that came to completely opposite conclusions while examining the extracellular H+ dynamics of horizontal cells following cell activation. One group attempted to monitor extracellular changes in H+ from isolated horizontal cells using the pH-sensitive dye 5-hexadecanoylamino-fluorescein (HAF); depolarization of horizontal cells resulted in an extracellular acidification, consistent with the H+ hypothesis of lateral inhibition. Using H+-selective microelectrodes in a self-referencing format, another research group reported that the depolarization of isolated horizontal cells induced an alkalinization of the extracellular milieu; the H+ hypothesis of lateral inhibition predicts an acidification instead.  I was able to show that despite being performed in same experimental conditions, opposite results were still obtained from the two techniques. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy revealed that HAF was not exclusively isolated to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane as previously assumed, but instead was found to be present extensively throughout the intracellular compartment. We confirmed that HAF is not reporting an extracellular acidification, but rather an acidification taking place within the cell’s interior.

This involves adopting consistent factorization and renormalization schemes which encompass both vector-boson-gluon-fusion (‘‘flavor creation’’) and vector-boson-massive-quark-scattering (‘‘flavor excitation’’) production mechanisms. It provides a framework which is valid from the threshold for producing the massive quark (where gluon fusion is dominant) to the very high energy regime when the typical energy scale μ is much larger than the quark mass m Q (where the quark scattering should be prevalent). This approach effectively resums all large logarithms of the type [α s (μ) ln (μ 2/m Q 2)] n which limit the validity of existing fixed-order calculations to the region μ∼ O (m Q). We show that the (massive) quark-scattering contribution (after subtraction of overlaps) is important in most parts …</div></div></div>|Author|MAG Aivazis and John C Collins and Fredrick I Olness and Wu-Ki Tung|Year|1994|Publisher|American Physical Society|Citedby|658|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9312319', '|Title|Proof of factorization for diffractive hard scattering|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A proof is given that hard-scattering factorization is valid for deep-inelastic processes which are diffractive or which have some other condition imposed on the final state in the target fragmentation region.</div></div></div>|Author|John C Collins|Year|1998|Publisher|American Physical Society|Citedby|603|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9709499', '|Title|Proof of factorization for diffractive hard scattering|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A proof is given that hard-scattering factorization is valid for deep-inelastic processes which are diffractive or which have some other condition imposed on the final state in the target fragmentation region.</div></div></div>|Author|John C Collins|Year|1998|Publisher|American Physical Society|Citedby|603|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9709499', '|Title|Proof of factorization for diffractive hard scattering|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A proof is given that hard-scattering factorization is valid for deep-inelastic processes which are diffractive or which have some other condition imposed on the final state in the target fragmentation region.</div></div></div>|Author|John C Collins|Year|1998|Publisher|American Physical Society|Citedby|603|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9709499', '|Title|A Large Hadron Electron Collider at CERNReport on the Physics and Design Concepts for Machine and Detector|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The physics programme and the design are described of a new collider for particle and nuclear physics, the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), in which a newly built electron beam of 60 GeV, to possibly 140 GeV, energy collides with the intense hadron beams of the LHC.

We investigate the signatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the delay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object locations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate interferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including the largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.

Advances in mapping and modeling of diffuse and point source foregrounds have improved subtraction accuracy, but no subtraction scheme is perfect. Precisely quantifying the errors and error correlations due to missubtracted foregrounds allows for both the rigorous analysis of the 21 cm power spectrum and for the maximal isolation of the “EoR window” from foreground contamination. We present a method to infer the covariance of foreground residuals from the data itself in contrast to previous attempts at a priori modeling. We demonstrate our method by setting limits on the power spectrum using a 3 h integration from the 128-tile Murchison Widefield Array.

The dish not only determines overall sensitivity, but also affects the observed frequency structure of foregrounds in the interferometer. This is the first of a series of four papers characterizing the frequency and angular response of the dish with simulations and measurements. In this paper, we focus on the angular response (ie, power pattern), which sets the relative weighting between sky regions of high and low delay and thus apparent source frequency structure. We measure the angular response at 137 MHz using the ORBCOMM …</div></div></div>|Author|Abraham R Neben and Richard F Bradley and Jacqueline N Hewitt and David R DeBoer and Aaron R Parsons and James E Aguirre and Zaki S Ali and Carina Cheng and Aaron Ewall-Wice and Nipanjana Patra and Nithyanandan Thyagarajan and Judd Bowman and Roger Dickenson and Joshua S Dillon and Phillip Doolittle and Dennis Egan and Mike Hedrick and Daniel C Jacobs and Saul A Kohn and Patricia J Klima and Kavilan Moodley and Benjamin RB Saliwanchik and Patrick Schaffner and John Shelton and HA Taylor and Rusty Taylor and Max Tegmark and Butch Wirt and Haoxuan Zheng|Year|2016|Publisher|IOP Publishing|Citedby|9|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03887', '|Title|Spectral energy distribution and radio halo of NGC 253 at low radio frequencies|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">We present new radio continuum observations of NGC 253 from the Murchison Widefield Array at frequencies between 76 and 227 MHz. We model the broadband radio spectral energy distribution for the total flux density of NGC 253 between 76 MHz and 11 GHz. The spectrum is best described as a sum of a central starburst and extended emission. The central component, corresponding to the inner 500 pc of the starburst region of the galaxy, is best modeled as an internally free–free absorbed synchrotron plasma, with a turnover frequency around 230 MHz. The extended emission component of the spectrum of NGC 253 is best described as a synchrotron emission flattening at low radio frequencies. We find that 34% of the extended emission (outside the central starburst region) at 1 GHz becomes partially absorbed at low radio frequencies.

Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal will require precise calibration of the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been pursued in recent years, including methods using redundancy in the antenna configuration. The newly upgraded Phase II of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is the first interferometer that has large numbers of redundant baselines while retaining good instantaneous UV coverage. This array therefore provides a unique opportunity to compare redundant calibration with sky-model-based algorithms.

The synthesis of MOFs generally involves the copolymerization of organic links and metal ions in a polar solvent under mild temperatures (up to 200 uC) and autogenous pressures (up to 100 atm). Since most products can be considered kinetically driven and lie on local thermodynamic minima, factors such as solubility of the organic link and metal salt, solvent polarity, ionic strength of the medium, temperature and pressure play critical roles in determining the character of products. Indeed, slight perturbations in synthetic parameters have been the basis for the preparation of what seems to be a flood of new MOF compounds. In the spirit of this discussion we advance the following ideas and developments that we believe contribute to the maturity of the field:(I) a conceptual framework that unifies the processes involved in the designed synthesis of MOFs, and which can be extended to other materials with extended structures;(II) a thesis concerning the possible structures that may form from building blocks with various shapes;(III) important considerations for achieving the design and synthesis of frameworks in which it is possible to change chemical functionality and metrics without changing the underlying framework topology;(IV) the inevitability of porosity for designed structures and some factors affecting …</div></div></div>|Author|Nathaniel L Rosi and Mohamed Eddaoudi and Jaheon Kim and Michael O’Keeffe and Omar M Yaghi|Year|2002|Publisher|Royal Society of Chemistry|Citedby|289|Eprint|http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/pdfPublications/displayarticleeonfree.pdf', '|Title|A new peptide-based method for the design and synthesis of nanoparticle superstructures: construction of highly ordered gold nanoparticle double helices|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Left-handed gold nanoparticle double helices were prepared using a new method that allows simultaneous synthesis and assembly of discrete nanoparticles.

Here we present a promising alternative strategy for constructing mesoporous metal-organic frameworks that addresses the size of the vertex rather than the length of the organic linker. This approach uses large metal-biomolecule clusters, in particular zinc-adeninate building units, as vertices to construct bio-MOF-100, an exclusively mesoporous metal-organic framework. Bio-MOF-100 exhibits a high surface area (4,300 m 2 g− 1), one of the lowest crystal densities (0.302 g cm− 3) and the largest metal-organic framework pore volume …</div></div></div>|Author|Jihyun An and Omar K Farha and Joseph T Hupp and Ehmke Pohl and Joanne I Yeh and Nathaniel L Rosi|Year|2012|Publisher|Nature Publishing Group|Citedby|225|Eprint|https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1618', '|Title|Stepwise ligand exchange for the preparation of a family of mesoporous MOFs|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A stepwise ligand exchange strategy is utilized to prepare a series of isoreticular <b>bio-MOF-100</b> analogues.

It is important to take into account that each method is applicable to a particular set of circumstances coupled with a number of factors influencing the success of a project. Therefore, it becomes crucial to match a method with the particular circumstances of the project.

We define PMC as a set of management practices formulated to achieve an organisation’s strategic goals and shape its strategic direction. While responsibility for performance measurement has generally been seen as that of the finance function of an organisation (ICAEW, 2009), the widespread use of balanced scorecards (Kaplan and Norton, 1996) and competitor analysis (Porter, 1990) has expanded the need for more non-financial data. In some sectors such as Higher Education (HE), the strategic planning team is being tasked with addressing this need (Lerner, 1999), though research on this aspect of PMC is limited (see Seneviratne and Hoque’s Chapter 24 in this volume). What we explore in this chapter through an illustrative case study is the role of planning in relation to other parties and how that has changed over a 5-year period. Both of the authors were employed in the case organisation during the period of the study (2010–2015), during which the title, role and responsibilities of the Director of Planning (DOP) changed, so it can be seen both as a longitudinal case study and as participatory action research. The methodology is based on a combination of documentary analysis and a series of loosely structured conversations between the authors around the themes of strategic planning and decision-making processes, organisational structure and the implementation of key performance indicators (KPIs).

Numerous methods of dehumanizing such persons were employed during this era. Of special significance was the use of the organism metaphor, whereby the “unfit” members of society were compared to a parasite, cancer, virus, or plague infecting the social body.

The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was influential in promoting accommodations for and nondiscrimination against people with diabetes in the workplace. This article discusses 3 of the elements that can make it difficult for persons with diabetes to file a successful claim under the ADA. These important elements include employee disability status, the ability to perform essential job functions, and direct threat concerns.</div></div></div>|Author|Gerald V O\'Brien and Melinda S Brown|Year|2008|Publisher|Taylor & Francis Group|Citedby|3|Eprint|', '|Title|Religious Metaphors as a Justification for Eugenic Control: A Historical Analysis|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">In conjunction with efforts to complete the mapping of the Human Genome, writings that detail the prospective benefits or fears that may accompany genetic innovations have been plentiful in popular literature and other media.

Such actions may be taken because of an employer\'s fear of contagion or the presumed response of co-workers, customers or others, fears of increased insurance costs, preexisting prejudice against gay men or intravenous drug users, and other reasons. One industrial sector where such discrimination appears to be widespread is the food-service industry. Many employers in food-service establishments believe that the known or rumored presence of an infected worker in their business will drive away customers, and result in substantial loss of revenue. Of course a major reason for this concern surrounds unsubstantiated fears of HIV contamination. The present study gauges the feelings of sixty-eight independent food-service supervisors in Illinois. It focuses specifically on the consequences that employers feel may follow in the wake of a known infected employee, the degree to which employers might take discriminating actions against persons, and the knowledge employers have of HIV contagion in the workplace. This study found that both the fear of consequences and the potential for discrimination were quite high, and significantly correlated with one another. Specific factors that employers noted as being principle sources of concern include the possible loss of customers, and the degree of disruption that might occur in the workplace resulting from a suspected case of HIV/AIDS among employees.</div></div>|Author|Gerald Vincent O\'Brien|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|', '|Title|Published on: May 28, 2013 ISBN-10: 0719087090 Language: English Pages: 225|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Tens of thousands of innocent persons in the US were involuntarily sterilized and forced into institutions within the course of the eugenic movement (1900–30).

In response to the growing importance of accountability in the educational process and the abundance of social networking technology and communication tools available for possible classroom use, this paper will use The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to examine the adoption of established and emerging information technology in higher education classrooms. Hence, the goal of this paper is to test theoretical explanations from UTAUT in the context of higher education through the development of a set of hypotheses predicting the conditions under which classroom technology use is likely to emerge. Data collection occurred via an online survey. The instrument was sent to business faculty members teaching face-to-face classes at a southeastern university. Our findings suggest that in the context of instructors’ use of technology for classroom purposes, the most important antecedents are performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and habit with more complex effects when gender is added as an interaction term. Results from this study will provide useful information on the frequency of use of technology, along with significant factors affecting its adoption in the classroom. Departmental leaders interested in the variations in individual faculty’s level of inclination toward technological changes would find them particularly useful.</div></div></div>|Author|Carmen C Lewis and Cherie E Fretwell and Jim Ryan and James B Parham|Year|1970|Publisher|Sciedu Press. 1120 Finch Avenue West Suite 701-309, Toronto Ontario, Canada M3J 3H7|Citedby|93|Eprint|https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1067507.pdf', '|Title|Soft innovation as data-driven process improvement exploited via integrated hospital information systems|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Soft innovations are regarded as insightful, useful ideas originating from stakeholders within the organization.

This increase in the number of knowledge transfer studies has also led to new insights regarding knowledge management systems (KMSs). Still, we know little about the role of social influence in stimulating individuals to share through KMSs. Thus, we propose a framework for examining the role of social influence at different levels of the organizational hierarchy and its effects on KMS usage. Specifically, the research model examines the moderating effect of the hierarchical level of an employee on the relationship between prior KMS use by employees at various hierarchical levels and current KMS use. We define a set of propositions based on social influence theory to further our understanding of how organizations can facilitate knowledge sharing within their boundaries.</div></div></div>|Author|Cherie E Fretwell and Carmen C Lewis and Jim Ryan|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|http://www.iiis.org/CDs2014/CD2014IMC/IMCIC_2014/PapersPdf/ZA885ZU.pdf', '|Title|Mining Perioperative Data for Business Process Analysis and Redesign: A Case Study Perspective.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This study examines data mining as an extension of system design to support continuous process improvement.

In this study, we searched for mutant alleles of TMPRSS3 in families from Pakistan and Newfoundland with recessive deafness co-segregating with DFNB8/B10 linked haplotypes and also more thoroughly characterized the genomic structure of TMPRSS3. We enrolled families segregating recessive hearing loss from Pakistan and Newfoundland. Microsatellite markers flanking the TMPRSS3 locus were used for linkage analysis. DNA samples from participating individuals were sequenced for TMPRSS3. The structure of TMPRSS3 was characterized bioinformatically and experimentally by sequencing novel cDNA clones of TMPRSS3. We identified mutations in TMPRSS3 in four Pakistani families with recessive, nonsyndromic congenital deafness. We also identified two recessive mutations, one of which is novel, of TMPRSS3 segregating in a six-generation extended family from Newfoundland. The spectrum of TMPRSS3 mutations is reviewed in the context of a genotype-phenotype correlation.

Clinical studies on a Newfoundland family over the past 30 years show that 11 relatives have a variable ocular phenotype ranging from microcornea to Peters anomaly, segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. To determine the molecular etiology of the variable ASD in this family, we sequenced nine functional candidate genes and identified 44 variants. A point mutation in FOXE3, which codes for a transcription factor involved in the formation of the lens and surrounding structures, co-segregated with the variable ocular phenotype. This novel mutation (c. 959G&gt; T) substitutes the stop codon for a leucine residue, predicting the addition of 72 amino acids to the C-terminus of FOXE3.

In particular, for a given angular dependence, the decay is always exponential—there are no power law tails at late times. In terms of the AdS-CFT correspondence, a large black hole corresponds to an approximately thermal state in the field theory, and the decay of the scalar field corresponds to the decay of a perturbation of this state. Thus one obtains the time scale for the approach to thermal equilibrium. We compute these time scales for the strongly coupled field theories in three, four, and six dimensions, which are dual to string theory in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</div></div></div>|Author|Gary T Horowitz and Veronika E Hubeny|Year|2000|Publisher|American Physical Society|Citedby|714|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9909056', '|Title|The gravitational Hamiltonian, action, entropy and surface terms|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">We give a derivation of the gravitational Hamiltonian starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action, keeping track of all surface terms.

Whereas in other systems these logics are additive, on the Web they can be                 recombinatory. Search, for example, can be conducted based on the structure of                 links, leading to new patterns of interaction, new links and new methods of search.                 Of greatest interest are the kinds of search where you don’t know what                 you’re looking for but will recognize it when you find it.

Placing the German debates in social and historical context, he identifies major narratives within the German foreign policy community from which emerge divergent interpretations of national identity. Through a discursive analysis of parliamentary debates, Bach highlights how the emergence of a"""" normal"""" foreign policy is caught between competing understandings of the nation and the ambiguous role of the state, as both increasingly confront the uncertain trajectories of integration and globalization. Mixing theoretical and empirical analyses, Bach charts the tension between universalism and particularism in German foreign policy and national identity from Germany\'s first unification to its most recent. The implications reach beyond Germany to shed light on the paradoxical relationship between politics, policy and identity amidst changing conceptions of state, nation, and the international system."""" An excellent piece of work: sophisticated, consistently well-informed, well organized and clearly written. It moves the debate on sovereignty and national identity into a distictly different key than that defined by such outstanding authors as David Campbell: the context provided by significant historiographical conflicts over the meaning and direction of foreign policy.

The global state system is a famously reified form of social organization, its defining doctrinal characteristic of state sovereignty based on an increasingly anachronistic single-point perspective (Ruggie 1993: 159). Today the social ordering functions of state sovereignty are under duress, global issues exist beyond the control of any one state, and the global political system is undergoing a significant transformation. Global political space is increasingly defined by networks that operate fluidly; enhance flows of money, people, commodities, ideas, and weapons; and accelerate trends. At the core of this oft-noted phenomenon of spatio-temporal compression is the co-evolution of organizational forms with interactive technologies (IT), a process that rearranges the ways firms produce, states fight wars, and people structure their lives. Changes to the organization of global political space are symbiotically linked to the emergence of new organizational forms of our epoch. These forms, whether benign or malevolent, reflect a shift from the hierarchical, bureaucratic concept of “mass”(mass production, mass media) to distributed, networked forms of production and communication. It is within this shift that the bones of the sovereign state system creak while trying to regulate transborder flows with institutions evolved to regulate life within territorial borders And it is within this shift that nonstate organizations (of all kinds) emerge to reterritorialize transborder flows in various ways (Sassen …</div></div></div>|Author|Jonathan Bach and David Stark|Year|1970|Publisher|Princeton University Press|Citedby|37|Eprint|http://www.columbia-coi.com/media/papers/bach_stark_rtnga.pdf', '|Title|The new spirit of German geopolitics|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This article explores how geopolitics, in various forms, became and remains central to Germany’s self-conception.

This holds out the prospect of opening up new geopolitical perspectives, where a ‘new geopolitics’ will be an attempt to ‘re-position’Germany within an international system whose marks are set by globalization and its privileging of the temporal over the spatial.

In this ethnography, Jonathan Bach examines the afterlife of East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, as things and places from that vanished socialist past continue to circulate and shape the politics of memory. What Remains traces the unsettling effects of these unmoored artifacts on the German present, arguing for a rethinking of the role of the everyday as a site of reckoning with difficult pasts. Bach juxtaposes four sites where the stakes of the everyday appear: products commodified as nostalgia, amateur museums dedicated to collecting everyday life under socialism, the"" people\'s palace"" that captured the national imagination through its destruction, and the feared and fetishized Berlin Wall. Moving from the local, the intimate, and the small to the national, the impersonal, and the large, this book\'s interpenetrating chapters show the unexpected social and political force of the ordinary in the production of memory.

This reinforces, rather than challenges, the principles of the sovereign state system. However, the paper then argues that citizens abroad have distinctive characteristics that complicate core conceptions of the nationstate: defining the scope of membership, signifying belonging, and negotiating rights and obligations. Because of this, the extension of the franchise does potentially add a transformative dimension to discussions about political community, national identity, and citizenship.

Politics without Sovereignty: A Critique of Contemporary International Relations, edited by Christopher J.

The book stakes a decidedly iconoclastic position within the considerable literature that addresses the nature of sovereignty in an era of globalization. Caustically critical of much contemporary writing on the subject, Bickerton, Cunliffe, Gourevitch, and their contributors take to task arguments as varied as Stephen Krasner’s (1999)‘‘organized hypocrisy,’’David Held’s (1995) cosmopolitanism, Alexander Wendt’s (1999) constructivism, Robert Jackson’s (1990)‘‘quasi-states,’’and Kofi Annan’s (1999) dual concept of sovereignty.

As a consequence, it is now admitted that it is possible to discriminate between healthy and ailing patients solely based on the analysis of language production. Most of these studies, however, were made on very small samples—30 participants per study, on an average—, or involved a great deal of manual work in their analysis. In this paper, we present an automatic analysis of transcripts of elderly participants describing six common objects. We used partof-speech and lexical richness as linguistic features to train an SVM classifier to automatically discriminate between healthy and AD patients in the early and moderate stages. The participants, in the corpus used for this study, were 63 Spanish adults over 55 years old (29 controls and 34 AD patients). With an accuracy of 88%, our experimental results compare favorably to those relying on the manual extraction of attributes, providing evidence that the need for manual analysis can be overcome without sacrificing in performance.</div></div></div>|Author|Laura Hernandez-Dominguez and Edgar García-Cano and Sylvie Ratté and Gerardo Sierra Martínez|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|5|Eprint|http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1902', '|Title|Computer-based evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment patients during a picture description task|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Introduction</h3><div class=""gsh_csp"">We present a methodology to automatically evaluate the performance of patients during picture description tasks.</div></div><div><h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Methods</h3><div class=""gsh_csp"">Transcriptions and audio recordings of the Cookie Theft picture description task were used.

In this work, we present an ongoing project for recollecting multilingual conversations with the elderly in Latin America. This project, so far, involves the combined efforts of psychogeriatricians, linguists, computer scientists, research nurses and geriatric caregivers from six institutions across USA, Canada, Mexico and Ecuador. The recollections are being made available to the international research community. They consist of conversations with adults aged sixty and over, with different nationalities and socio-economic backgrounds. Conversations are recorded on video, transcribed and time-aligned. Additionally, we are in the process of receiving written texts—recent or old—authored by the participants, provided voluntarily. Each participant is recorded at least twice a year to allow longitudinal studies. Furthermore, information such as medical history, educational background, economic level, occupation, medications and treatments is being registered to aid conducting research on treatment progress and pharmacological effects. Potential studies derived from this work include speech, voice, writing, discourse, and facial and corporal expression analysis. We believe that our recollections incorporate complementary data that can aid researchers in further understanding the progression of cognitive degenerative diseases of the elderly.</div></div></div>|Author|Laura Hernandez-Dominguez and Sylvie Ratte and Boyd Davis and Charlene Pope|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1903', '|Title|Rhetorical Relations in the Speech of Alzheimer’s Patients and Healthy Elderly Subjects: An Approach from the RST|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The study is aimed to extract discourse relations patterns in conversational speech of subjects with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and adults with healthy aging processes using the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST).

The procedure involved the segmentation of each conversational discourse into Semantic Dialog Units (SDUs), the labeling of their rhetorical relations and the construction of tree diagrams. We perform acorrelation analysis to determine the significance of the use of rhetorical relations for each group. We found a significantly (p-value&lt;. 05) lower rhetorical relations production density in subjects with AD.
