Indeed, when one sibling is asked to compare themselves to others in their family, birth order shows weak-to-moderate effects on personality (e.g., Healey and Ellis, 2007, Paulhus et al., 1999). No study to date, however, has utilized a complete within-family design that includes independent self-reports from both firstborn and laterborn siblings in the same family. To fill this gap, we collected Big Five personality data on 69 young adult firstborn–laterborn sibling pairs. We also obtained data from parents of the sibling pairs and peer ratings of original participants’ personality traits. Within-family analyses revealed that neither siblings’ independent self-reported personality traits, nor parents’ reports of their children’s personality traits, differed systematically as a function of birth order. Our findings are consistent with …</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|April Bleske-Rechek and Jenna A Kelley|Year|2014|Publisher|Pergamon|Citedby|40|Eprint|https://bleske-rechek.com/April%20Website%20Files/Bleske-Rechek%20and%20Kelley%202013.%20Birth%20order%20and%20personality.pdf', '|Title|General and domain-specific beliefs about intelligence, ability, and effort among preservice and practicing teachers|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">This study examined preservice and practicing teachers’ beliefs about factors influencing student academic performance. Participants viewed teacher factors as a more important determinant of academic performance than student or family factors.

Teachers held the most ability-based views of performance in the arts and the most effort-based views of performance in the humanities.

Parents were asked to use both quantitative measures and qualitative vignettes to report how they would talk to their pre-adolescent child about race. In line with previous research (Hughes et al., 2006), parents predominantly adopted an egalitarian socialization strategy, suggesting that everyone should be treated the same, regardless of race. Although White parents indicated they found both present and future discussions of race important, when given the opportunity with qualitative vignettes, many parents did not include race or racial issues in their responses. This indicates a pattern of colorblind or colormute socialization that has been reflected in White racial socialization literature; the idea that race should not matter and should not be discussed with children. Egalitarian socialization was linked to White racial identity statuses, but not related to racial bias or school diversity estimates.</div></div>|Author|Jenna Anne Kelley|Year|2016|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/22020/Kelley_ku_0099M_14856_DATA_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', '|Title|Racial socialization practices among White American parents: Relations to racial attitudes, racial identity, and school diversity|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This study examines racial socialization practices among White American parents (<i>N</i> = 154) of children aged 8 to 12 years, using both quantitative and qualitative measures, as well as the relations of racial attitudes, racial identity, and racial diversity of the schools that children attend to socialization practices. Responses on the qualitative socialization measure indicate that White parents are generally unlikely to discuss race or racism with their children in a direct, explicit fashion, even when the parents are responding to a situation in which racial bias is clear and salient. Parents with less biased racial attitudes were more likely to engage in color-conscious racial socialization and to present socialization messages that emphasized egalitarianism and the existence of racial discrimination.

Although between family designs have consistently failed to find effects of birth order, a modified within-family design has documented predicted effects. That is, when one sibling compares him/herself to their siblings, birth order predicts who is nominated as the most conscientious and who is most open or rebellious (unconventional). However, directly comparing oneself to one\'s sibling encourages contrast effects. The purpose of this study was to employ a true within-family design that uses independent self-report data from both a firstborn and laterborn adult sibling from each family (in addition to parent reports of both siblings). In accord with Judith Rice Harris\' theory of personality development, it was expected that neither adult siblings\' independent self-reported personality traits nor parents\' reports of those siblings\' personality traits would differ by birth order.</div></div>|Author|Jenna A Kelley|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/66786/KelleySpr2013.pdf?sequence=1', '|Title|Does Rearing Environment Shape Romantic Attachment Style? Using Siblings to Test for Shared Environmental Influences|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Attachment research began when John Bowlby recognized the importance of the bonds, or ""attachments,"" formed between infants and their caregivers. In the late 1980s, psychologists extended Bowlby\'s research into the domain of adult romantic love by proposing that romantic love can be conceptualized as a process of becoming attached (e.g., Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987). Since Hazan and Shaver\'s (1987) initial conceptualization of romantic love as an attachment process, researchers have documented links between attachment dimensions and memories of one\'s relationships with parents during childhood, parental relationship status (e.g., divorced), and one\'s own current and past romantic relationship experiences. Research has not, however, determined the causes of individual differences in romantic attachment style. A series of studies were conducted to explore the possibility that romantic attachment style is transmitted via the family, either through shared genes or shared rearing environment.</div></div>|Author|Amy E Johnson and Bethany R Franklin and Jenna A Kelley|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/63033/Johnson3Spr2012.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', '|Title|Birth Order and Personality: Testing Assumptions with Independent Siblings\' Reports|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Assumptions about the effects of birth order on personality abound in popular culture, self-help books, and the scholarly literature. Judith Rich Harris has proposed that, if birth order does affect individuals\' behavior, it does so only within the family context. According to Harris, tactics that may be effective at home for a child of a given birth order are not necessarily going to be effective for that child in other contexts. There is no known study that has directly tested Harris\' theory by assessing two adult siblings who were raised in the same home, and comparing their personalities as a function of their birth order. This study was designed with that specific objective, with the prediction (in accord with Harris\' theory) that adult siblings\' independent self-reports would not differ as a function of birth order.</div></div>|Author|Bethany R Franklin and Amy E Johnson and Jenna A Kelley|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/64540/FranklinSpr2012.pdf?sequence=1']"

The contrast in the images produced is related to changes in the X-ray refractive index of the tissues, resulting in remarkable clarity compared with conventional X-ray images based on absorption effects. These changes were greatest at the boundaries between different tissues, giving a marked edge enhancement effect and three-dimensional appearance to the images.

Using these techniques, one can gain an insight into the biochemical composition of cells and tissues by looking at the spectra produced and comparing them with spectra obtained from standards such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates.

This process leads to fetal anemia, and in severe cases can progress to edema, ascites, heart failure, and death. Infants affected with HDFN can have hyperbilirubinemia in the acute phase and hyporegenerative anemia for weeks to months after birth. The diagnosis and management of pregnant women with HDFN is based on laboratory and radiographic monitoring. Fetuses with marked anemia may require intervention with intrauterine transfusion. HDFN due to RhD can be prevented by RhIg administration.

Desta forma, buscou-se estudar os Processos Oxidativos Avançados (POAs), mais especificamente a fotocatálise heterogênea, que baseada na radiação (UV) sobre um catalisador, gera radicais hidroxila (HO•) altamente reativos, capaz de mineralizar uma variedade de compostos orgânicos formando compostos inócuos. Para estudar a cinética de degradação e avaliar a influência da concentração inicial de 2, 4, 6-triclorofenol e de 2, 4, 6-tribromofenol, a concentração do catalisador e o pH, elaborou-se uma matriz experimental, resultando em dezesseis ensaios.

By using ethnographic techniques to study the day-to-day practices of strategy making in one firm, I examine the ways actors attempted to transform their own cognitive frames of a situation into predominant frames through a series of interactions. Frames are the means by which managers make sense of ambiguous information from their environments. Actors each had cognitive frames about the direction the market was taking and about what kinds of solutions would be appropriate. Where frames about a strategic choice were not congruent, actors engaged in highly political framing practices to make their frames resonate and to mobilize action in their favor. Those actors who most skillfully engaged in these practices shaped the frame that prevailed in the organization.

This qualitative analysis sheds light on questions that have perennially plagued executives and intrigued scholars: How do organizations change routines in order to overcome inertia in the face of radical change in the environment? And, specifically, what is the role of the CEO in this process? Inertial behavior in such circumstances has been attributed to ingrained routines that are based on cognitive and motivational truces. Routines are performed because organizational participants find them to cohere to a particular cognitive frame about what should be done (the cognitive dimension) and to resolve conflicts about what gets rewarded or sanctioned (the motivational dimension).

Despite a wealth of literature on mixing qualitative and quantitative methods (Bryman, 2006; Creswell &amp; Clark, 2007; Jick, 1979; Small, 2011), rarely do individual scholars conduct both forms of research, and even more rarely do they present them together in a single scholarly work. Quantitative researchers may view qualitative research as suspect, or only as a means to generate hypotheses to test in quantitative analyses. According to this view, qualitative research is but an intermediate output supporting “empirical” regression analysis. On the other hand however, qualitative researchers often view quantitative work as too reductive. They may only include quantitative data for rhetorical purposes, recognizing that they are outnumbered (no pun intended) in a world dominated by scholars untrained in qualitative methods.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">There are many understandings of the words qualitative and quantitative within various research traditions.

Company cases are essentially stories, and stories are ways of conveying understanding, creating meaning, and justifying action. We can still use these company narratives as part of a process of reflection and dialogue.

We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the …</div></div></div>|Author|Megan L Peterson and Daniel F Doak and William F Morris|Year|2018|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Megan_Peterson7/publication/330026606_Incorporating_local_adaptation_into_forecasts_of_species%27_distribution_and_abundance_under_climate_change/links/5c51cdc8458515a4c74b05cd/Incorporating-local-adaptation-into-forecasts-of-species-distribution-and-abundance-under-climate-change.pdf', '|Title|Climate and synchrony with conspecifics determine the effects of flowering phenology on reproductive success in Silene acaulis|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Changes in flowering phenology resulting from climate change could impact individual plant fitness and population viability. Flowering phenology can mediate plant reproductive success in several ways, including pollinator interactions, flowering synchrony with conspecifics, and timing of suitable abiotic conditions. We explored factors that control phenology and reproductive success for an alpine cushion plant, <i>Silene acaulis</i>, across two years and four sites, totaling 1,123 plants, in Colorado, USA. We investigated relationships between flowering time, flowering synchrony, and reproductive success with local abiotic conditions and pollinator behavior. Mean flowering phenology was strongly correlated with the timing of snowmelt across sites and years.

Species generally arise in new environments through a combination of ecological divergence and spatial isolation. Under this framework, speciation occurs through three main processes: 1) niche expansion, 2) divergent selection, and 3) the accumulation of reproductive isolating mechanisms. In this dissertation, I tested specific hypotheses about the factors governing each of these stages, using a combination of stochastic simulations and field and greenhouse experiments with life history ecotypes of common monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus DC (Phrymaceae). First, I tested the ecological and genetic determinants of colonization success in flowering plants. In particular, I used stochastic simulations to test the effect of mating system plasticity on the persistence and adaptation of colonizing populations in new environments. I found that a shift to a mixed mating strategy facilitated niche expansion by reducing extinction and promoting adaptation under a broad range of colonization scenarios. In my second and third chapters, I examined the causes and consequences of life history divergence among populations of M. guttatus in central California. In chapter two, I used comparative demography to test for local adaptation and selection on life history traits in a common garden experiment in a montane perennial environment. I found that a perennial life history strategy had the highest performance and that selection favored perennial life history traits, although the native montane perennial ecotype was not locally adapted relative to other inland perennial …</div></div>|Author|Megan L Peterson|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2mt2289x/qt2mt2289x.pdf', '|Title|Use of Low Plasticity for Soil Liners and Covers|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Loess, which consists predominantly of low plasticity to non-plastic silt (PI? 10) with varying amounts of sand and clay-sized (-5 microns) material, covers much of north-central Oregon and eastern Washington. Several landfills operate in this area. Because of the lack of clayey soils and clayey bedrock in the region, loess was proposed for use as the low permeability soil barrier layer. Laboratory testing and large-scale field tests of test fills using SDRI\'s have shown that the remolded permeability of the loess is related to grain-size, soil gradation, and the percent saturation of the placed soil. We had an approximately 1: 1 correlation between the permeability results of laboratory remolded samples, undisturbed Shelby tube samples of test fills, and field SDRI tests. Data from six different sites have consistently shown that in order to achieve a permeability of less than 1x10-6 cm/s, the loess must contain greater than 70 percent minus US No. 200 sieve and have at least 15 percent minus 5 microns material. In addition, the loess must be placed at a minimum of 2 percent over standard Proctor optimum moisture content and be compacted to a dry density which corresponds to a minimum of 85 percent saturation at the measured moisture content.</div></div></div>|Author|Clifford C Knitter and KG Haskell and ML Peterson|Year|1970|Publisher|University of Missouri--Rolla|Citedby||Eprint|http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2234&context=icchge']"

Two broad methods have been used, one based on degree of DNA sequence variation, within and between species and another requiring the recovery of species as discrete clades (monophyly) on a phylogenetic tree. An alternative method relies on the identification of a set of specific diagnostic nucleotides for a given species (characters). The genus <i>Drosophila</i> has long served as a model system in genetics, development, ecology and evolutionary biology.

Nearly 1,000 species of endemic drosophilids have evolved in situ in Hawaii since a single colonist arrived over 25 million years ago. A number of mechanisms, including ecological adaptation, sexual selection, and geographic isolation, have been proposed to explain the evolution of this hyperdiverse group of species. Here, we examine the known ecological associations of 326 species of endemic Hawaiian Drosophilidae in light of the phylogenetic relationships of these species. Our analysis suggests that the long-accepted belief of strict ecological specialization in this group does not hold for all taxa. While many species have a primary host plant family, females will also oviposit on non-preferred host plant taxa. Host shifting is fairly common in some groups, especially the grimshawi and modified mouthparts species groups of Drosophila, and the Scaptomyza subgenus Elmomyza. Associations with types of substrates (bark, leaves, flowers) are more evolutionarily conserved than associations with host plant families.

A simultaneous analysis framework was used to examine the congruence of the chromosomal inversion data with more recent DNA sequence data in four Drosophila species groups – the melanogaster, virilis, repleta, and picture wing. Inversions and nucleotides were highly congruent with one another based on incongruence length difference and partitioned Bremer support values. Inversion phylogenies were less resolved because of fewer numbers of characters.

The Hawaiian Islands are often referred to as a ‘‘conveyor belt” archipelago (Carson and Clague, 1995); as the Pacific plate moves to the northwest over a stationary hotspot, islands are formed, carried with the plate, and gradually subside at a more-or-less constant rate (Price and Clague, 2002; Ziegler, 2002). This hotspot has been active for over 40 million years (Carson and Clague, 1995) and has resulted in a chain of successively older islands, seamounts, and atolls stretching northwest across the Pacific. Currently, there are eight ‘‘high islands” in the southeast of the chain that, at over 1000 m in elevation, are able to support a diverse flora and fauna. The youngest island, dated at less than 600,000 years old, is the Big Island of Hawai ‘i. Kaua ‘i, at about 5 million years old, is the oldest high island (Price and Clague, 2002). Extreme isolation, coupled with the unique geology and environmental conditions of the islands, has made Hawai ‘i a ‘‘natural laboratory” where the effects of evolution are readily observable (Kaneshiro, 1995). Over 850 endemic flowering plant (Wagner et al., 1990) and 4000 endemic insect species (Liebherr, 2001) are each thought to have been derived from about 200 colonization events.

O PFT foi estudado em 44 crianças saudáveis (26 meninos e 18 meninas), selecionadas de acordo com o questionário ATS-DLD-78-C, utilizado para detectar a presença de doenças respiratórias de base e exposição ambiental. O medidor de pico de fluxo expiratório (Piko-I Electronic Peak Flow Meter, Pulmonary Data Services, USA) foi usado para mensurar o PFT. A taxa de sucesso foi definida como a porcentagem de crianças capazes de realizar o teste de acordo com os critérios de aceitabilidade e reprodutibilidade. Para avaliar a reprodutibilidade teste-reteste, 10 crianças (de acordo com o cálculo amostral) foram reavaliadas após três semanas. A reprodutibilidade teste-reteste foi avaliada pelo teste t pareado, considerando significativo p&lt; 0, 05 e coeficiente de correlação intraclasse (CCI).

In particular, we focus on the abilities to identify and to describe one’s own emotion, and consider how this ability may co-vary with, and even cause, difficulties in representing the other. We take an individual differences approach; the ability to identify and describe one’s own emotions varies considerably across individuals and this ability predicts the ability to recognize, represent and empathize with the emotions of others. Within the clinical domain, impairments in emotion recognition and empathy have been reported in numerous disorders, yet empirical findings have been equivocal. In autism, eating disorders, schizophrenia and many other clinical populations, mixed evidence concerning these abilities has produced an extremely inconsistent literature. Here, we consider whether alexithymia, associated with difficulties identifying and describing one’s own emotions, is responsible for the mixed empirical findings. Alexithymia is known to co-occur with several disorders associated with inconsistent reports of affective impairments, making it possible that this sub-clinical phenomenon may be responsible for emotion-related atypicalities across these disorders. The following discussion presents existing evidence for this alexithymia hypothesis, and highlights areas requiring further investigation. If supported, the alexithymia hypothesis provides evidence for the necessity of intact representations of one’s own emotions in representing those of other individuals.</div></div></div>|Author|Rebecca Brewer and Richard Cook and Geoffrey Bird|Year|2016|Publisher|Cambridge University Press|Citedby|5|Eprint|', '|Title|Parental relationships and emotional distress and well-being among college women|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Research suggests divorce can have significant effects on the emotional well-being of children and adolescents.

The HCT is often employed as measure of interoception – the ability to perceive the internal state of one’s body – however it’s use remains controversial as performance on the HCT is strongly influenced by knowledge of resting heart rate. This raises the possibility that heart rate knowledge may mediate the previously-observed association between intelligence and HCT performance. Study One demonstrates an association between intelligence and HCT performance (<i>N</i>\u202f=\u202f94), and Study Two demonstrates that this relationship is mediated by knowledge of the average resting heart rate (<i>N</i>\u202f=\u202f134).

The presence of alexithymia in these conditions predicts poorer regulation of one\'s emotions, decreased treatment response, and increased burden on carers. While clinically important, the aetiology of alexithymia is still a matter of debate, with several authors arguing for multiple ‘routes’ to impaired understanding of one\'s own emotions, which may or may not result in distinct subtypes of alexithymia.

Findings of ‘unfitness’ are so rare that there is considerable professional unease concerning the utility of the current subjective assessment process. As a result, mentally disordered defendants may be subjected unfairly to criminal trials. The Law Commission in England and Wales has proposed legal reform, as well as the utilisation of a defined psychiatric instrument to assist in fitness to plead assessments. Similar legal reforms are occurring in other jurisdictions. Our objective was to produce and validate a standardised assessment instrument of fitness to plead employing a filmed vignette of criminal proceedings. The instrument was developed in consultation with legal and clinical professionals, and was refined using standard item reduction methods in two initial rounds of testing (n = 212). The factorial structure, test-retest reliability and convergent validity of the resultant instrument were assessed in a further round (n = 160). As a result of this iterative process a 25-item scale was produced, with an underlying two-factor structure representing the foundational and decision-making abilities underpinning fitness to plead. The sub-scales demonstrate good internal consistency (factor 1: 0·76; factor 2: 0·65) and test-retest stability (0·7) as well as excellent convergent validity with scores of intelligence, executive function and mentalising abilities (p?0·01 in all domains).

However, because previous studies have utilised identical images as base stimuli, physical differences between base and oddball stimuli, rather than recognition of identity or emotion, may have been responsible for oddball responses. This study tested two new FPVS paradigms designed to distinguish recognition of expressions of emotion from basic detection of visual change. In both paradigms, the oddball emotional expression was different from that of the base stream images. However, in the\'fixed-emotion\'paradigm, stimulus image varied at every presentation but the emotion in the base stream remained constant, and in the\'mixed-emotions\' paradigm, both stimulus image and emotion varied at every presentation, with only the oddball emotion (disgust) remaining constant. In the fixed-emotion paradigm, typical inversion effects were observed at occipital sites. In the mixed-emotions paradigm, however, inversion effects in a central cluster (indicative of higher level emotion processing) were present in typical participants, but not those with alexithymia (who are impaired at emotion recognition), suggesting that only the mixed-emotions paradigm reflects emotion recognition rather than lower-level visual processing or basic detection of change.

Most commonly, these measures are of: 1) the ability to form an accurate percept of the body’s state, 2) confidence in the accuracy of a specific interoceptive percept at a particular point in time, and 3) trait differences in the degree to which one is aware of interoceptive information. At present, however, there is a paucity of measures designed to assess trait differences in self-perceived interoceptive accuracy. This paper reports on the development of such a measure, the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS). Across six studies we report on the IAS factor structure, test-retest reliability, and its relationship with measures of trait interoceptive awareness, accuracy of interoceptive percepts, confidence in the accuracy of specific interoceptive percepts, and metacognition with respect to interoceptive accuracy (‘interoceptive insight’). Results support the distinction between individual differences in awareness of interoceptive information and in the accuracy of interoceptive perception, and suggest that both accuracy and awareness can be measured using both objective measures and self-report instruments such as the IAS.</div></div></div>|Author|Jennifer Murphy and Rebecca Brewer and David Plans and Sahib S Khalsa and Caroline Catmur and Geoffrey Bird|Year|2018|Publisher|PsyArXiv|Citedby||Eprint|https://psyarxiv.com/fqgu4/download?format=pdf', '|Title|The relationship between one\'s own interoceptive abilities and recognition of others\' non-emotional internal state|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Much research has investigated the ability to recognise others\' emotions (happiness, fear, anger, etc.) and previous work suggests that the ability to recognise an emotional state in another individual is strongly related to the ability to recognise one\'s own emotions.

In this report, we examine in detail the additional steps and costs that transgender people may encounter in order to vote at the polls in states with the strictest photo identification laws.</div></div>|Author|Taylor NT Brown and Jody Herman|Year|2016|Publisher||Citedby|2|Eprint|', '|Title|Exploring International Priorities & Best Practices for Collecting Data on Gender Minorities|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr"">Author(s): Brown, Taylor NT; Herman, Jody L.; Park, Andrew S.\n</div>|Author|Taylor NT Brown and Jody L Herman and Andrew S Park|Year|2017|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|', '|Title|Children and Families Impacted and the Fiscal Implications of Texas CSHB 3864|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">CSHB 3864, if enacted, would allow agencies licensed to make foster care or adoption placement decisions in the state of Texas to do so in accordance with their own sincerely-held religious beliefs.

Chain reactions caused by these tiny acts of participation form a growing part of collective action today, from neighborhood campaigns to global political movements. Political Turbulence reveals that, in fact, most attempts at collective action online do not succeed, but some give rise to huge mobilizations—even revolutions. Drawing on large-scale data generated from the Internet and real-world events, this book shows how mobilizations that succeed are unpredictable, unstable, and often unsustainable. To better understand this unruly new force in the political world, the authors use experiments that test how social media influence citizens deciding whether or not to participate. They show how different personality types react to social influences and identify which types of people are willing to participate at an early stage in a mobilization when there are few supporters or signals of viability. The authors argue that pluralism is the model of democracy that is emerging in the social media age—not the ordered, organized vision of early pluralists, but a chaotic, turbulent form of politics. This book demonstrates how data science and experimentation with social data can provide a methodological toolkit for understanding, shaping, and perhaps even predicting the outcomes of this democratic turbulence.</div></div>|Author|Helen Margetts and Peter John and Scott Hale and Taha Yasseri|Year|1970|Publisher|Princeton University Press|Citedby|165|Eprint|', '|Title|Petition Growth and Success Rates on the UK No. 10 Downing Street Website|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Now that so much of collective action takes place online, web-generated data can further understanding of the mechanics of Internet-based mobilisation.

Petition signing is an example of collective action which has gained in popularity with rising use of social media and provides such data for the whole population of petition signatories for a given platform. This paper tracks the growth curves of all 20,000 petitions to the UK government petitions website (                   http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk                                    ) and 1,800 petitions to the US White House site (                   https://petitions.whitehouse.gov                                    ), analyzing the rate of growth and outreach mechanism.

We analyze the data through a multiplicative process model framework to explain the heterogeneous growth of signatures at the population level. We define and measure an average outreach factor for petitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1% after 10 hours in the UK and 30 hours in the US).

A research frontier is hence emerging which involves exploring the type of measures that can be drawn from data stores such as mobile phone logs, Internet searches and contributions to social media platforms and the extent to which these measures are accurate reflections of the wider population. This paper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which local commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter. It makes three contributions in particular. First, it shows that heuristics applied to geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting patterns; one which outperforms the current best method for estimating these patterns (the radiation model). This finding is of particular significance because we make use of relatively coarse geolocation data (at the city level) and use simple heuristics based on frequency counts. Second, it investigates sources of error in the proxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with higher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds that, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact that the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the population as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond simple frequency heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models.</div></div>|Author|Graham McNeill and Jonathan Bright and Scott A Hale|Year|2017|Publisher|SpringerOpen|Citedby|14|Eprint|https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0120-x', '|Title|Investigating political participation and social information using big data and a natural experiment|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Social information is particularly prominent in digital settings where the design of platforms can more easily give real-time information about the behaviour of peers and reference groups and thereby stimulate political activity. Changes to these platforms can generate natural experiments allowing an assessment of the impact of changes in social information and design on participation. This paper investigates the impact of the introduction of trending information on the homepage of the UK government petitions platform. Using interrupted time series and a regression discontinuity design, we find that the introduction of the trending feature had no statistically significant effect on the overall number of signatures per day, but that the distribution of signatures across petitions changes: the most popular petitions gain even more signatures at the expense of those with less signatories. We find significant differences between petitions trending at different ranks, even after controlling for each petition\'s individual growth prior to trending. The findings suggest a non-negligible group of individuals visit the homepage of the site looking for petitions to sign and therefore see the list of trending petitions, and a significant proportion of this group responds to the social information that it provides. These findings contribute to our understanding of how social information, and the form in which it is presented, affects individual political behaviour in digital settings.</div></div></div>|Author|Scott A Hale and Peter John and Helen Margetts and Taha Yasseri|Year|2014|Publisher||Citedby|14|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3562.pdf?utm_content=buffer8e405&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer', '|Title|Iterative 3-d pose correction and content-based image retrieval for dorsal fin recognition|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Contour or boundary descriptors may be used in content-based image retrieval to effectively identify appropriate images when image content consists primarily of a single object of interest.

We study multilingualism by collecting and analyzing a large dataset of the content written by multilingual editors of the English, German, and Spanish editions of Wikipedia.

In contrast, users editing the English edition as a second language make edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit the English edition. In this way, English serves a special role bringing together content written by multilinguals from many language editions.

The higher percentage of links being shared on Wikipedia is attributed to the persistence of links and the ability for users to link articles on the same topic together across languages.</div></div></div>|Author|Scott Hale|Year|2012|Publisher|ACM|Citedby|8|Eprint|https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:60d9d2eb-29d4-4193-b39d-733f6f0a5b0c/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Scott%2BHale%252C%2BImpact%2Bof%2Bplatform%2Bdesign%2Bon%2Bcross-language%2Binformation%2Bexchange.pdf&type_of_work=Conference', '|Title|Live versus Archive: Comparing a Web Archive and to a Population of Webpages|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">With its seemingly limitless scope, the World Wide Web promises enormous advantages, along with enormous problems, to researchers who seek to use it as a source of data. Websites change continually and a high level of flux makes it challenging to capture a snapshot of the web, or even a cross-section of a small subset of the web. A web archive, such as those at the Internet Archive, promises to store and deliver repeated cross-sections of the entire web, and it also offers the potential for longitudinal analysis. Whether this potential is realized depends on the extent to which the archive has truly captured the web. Therefore, a crucial question for Internet researchers is: ‘How good are the archival data?’ We ask if there are systematic biases in the Internet Archive, using a case study to address this question. Specifically, we are interested in whether biases exist in the British websites stored in the Internet Archive data. We find that the Internet Archive contains a surprisingly small subset, about 24%, of the webpages of the website that we use for our case study (the travel site, TripAdvisor). Furthermore, the subset of data we found in the Internet Archive appears to be biased and is not a random sample of the webpages on the site. The archived data we examine has a bias toward prominent webpages. This bias could create serious problems for research using archived websites.</div></div>|Author|Scott A Hale and Grant Blank and Victoria D Alexander|Year|2017|Publisher|UCL Press|Citedby|6|Eprint|http://research.gold.ac.uk/20698/1/Live%20versus%20Archive%20Chapter%20Final%20Typescript.pdf', '|Title|Explaining usage patterns in Open Government Data: the case of Data. gov. uk|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Open data is one of the most significant current trends in public administration, with over 100 current open government projects around the world investing considerable time and effort in opening up public sector information for free re-use.

This social information is hypothesized to impact the distribution of political activity, stimulating participation in mobilizations that are increasing in popularity, and depressing participation in those that appear to be less popular, leading to a non-normal distribution. Changes to these platforms can generate natural experiments allowing for an estimate of the impact of different kinds of social information on participation. This paper tests the hypothesis that social information shapes the distribution of political mobilizations by examining the introduction of trending information to the homepage of the UK government petition platform. The introduction of the trending feature did not increase the overall number of signatures per day, but the distribution of signatures across petitions changed significantly—the most popular petitions gained more signatures at the expense of those with fewer signatories. We further find significant differences between petitions trending at different ranks on the homepage. This evidence suggests that the ubiquity of trending information on digital platforms is introducing instability into political markets, as has been shown for cultural markets. As well as highlighting the importance of digital design in shaping political behaviour, the findings suggest that a non-negligible group of individuals visit the homepage of the site looking for petitions to sign, without having decided the issues they …</div></div>|Author|Scott A Hale and Peter John and Helen Margetts and Taha Yasseri|Year|2018|Publisher|Public Library of Science|Citedby|5|Eprint|https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196068', '|Title|Does Campaigning on Social Media Make a Difference?

However, studies of the impact of campaigning on social platform have thus far been limited to cross-sectional datasets from one election period which are vulnerable to unobserved variable bias. Hence empirical evidence on the effectiveness of political social media activity is thin. We address this deficit by analysing a novel panel dataset of political Twitter activity in the 2015 and 2017 elections in the United Kingdom. We find that Twitter based campaigning does seem to help win votes, a finding which is consistent across a variety of different model specifications including a first difference regression. The impact of Twitter use is small in absolute terms, though comparable with that of campaign spending. Our data also support the idea that effects are mediated through other communication channels, hence challenging the relevance of engaging in an interactive fashion.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Subjects: Social and Information Networks (cs.

Such identification is useful for biological studies of population, social interaction, migration, etc. The process whereby fin outlines are extracted in current fin-recognition software packages is manually intensive and represents a major user input bottleneck: it is both time consuming and visually fatiguing. This research aims to develop automated methods (employing unsupervised thresholding and morphological processing techniques) to extract cetacean dorsal fin outlines from digital photographs thereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will improve the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to correctly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space were examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable threshold could be easily identified. To assist with unsupervised thresholding, a new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures ("" pixelarity"") in an image after thresholding. The metric indicates how cleanly a threshold segments background and foreground elements and hence provides a good measure of the quality of a given threshold. This research results in successful extractions in roughly 93% of images, and significantly reduces user-input time.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

Dog vaccination campaigns implemented through collaborative effort between the government and NGOs have played an important role in successfully reducing the burden of disease within the country. Nevertheless, rabies vaccination of the domestic animal population requires continuous commitment not only from governments and NGOs, but also from local communities that are directly affected by such efforts.

We built a spreadsheet tool, RabiesEcon, to aid public health officials to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dog rabies vaccination programs in East Africa.   Methods RabiesEcon uses a mathematical model of dog-dog and dog-human rabies transmission to estimate dog rabies cases averted, the cost per human rabies death averted and cost per year of life gained (YLG) due to dog vaccination programs (US 2015 dollars). We used an East African human population of 1 million (approximately 2/3 living in urban setting, 1/3 rural). We considered, using data from the literature, three vaccination options; no vaccination, annual vaccination of 50% of dogs and 20% of dogs vaccinated semi-annually. We assessed 2 transmission scenarios: low (1.2 dogs infected per infectious dog) and high (1.7 dogs infected). We also examined the impact of annually vaccinating 70% of all dogs (World Health Organization recommendation for dog rabies elimination).   Results Without dog vaccination, over 10 years there would a total of be approximately 44,000–65,000 rabid dogs and 2,100–2,900 human deaths. Annually vaccinating 50% of dogs results in 10-year reductions of 97% and 75% in rabid dogs (low and high transmissions scenarios, respectively), approximately 2,000–1,600 human deaths averted, and an undiscounted cost-effectiveness of $451-$385 per life saved. Semi-annual vaccination of 20% of dogs results in in 10-year reductions of 94% and 78% in rabid dogs, and approximately 2,000–1,900 human deaths averted, and cost $404-$305 per life saved.

Two ORV bait designs are primarily utilized for the distribution of vaccinia rabies glycoprotein (VRG) vaccine: a fish meal polymer block and a coated sachet. A primary public health concern related to ORV bait distribution is non-target contact between the ORV and humans and domestic pets. The VRG virus strain used in ORV is attenuated in mice, but human percutaneous exposure to ruptured sachets has resulted in localized vaccinia virus infection in very rare cases. Recently, a new recombinant human adenovirus ORV (AdRG) has been developed. This vaccine is incorporated in ultralight bait which has not previously been used in the United States. Surveillance for human contact is important, particularly among young children that may have contact with the bait, due to their lower prevalence of prior exposure and immunity to human adenoviruses. To evaluate potential differences in contact rates between the VRG and AdRG bait types CDC, the Ohio Department of Health, and USDA/WS will conduct an investigation during ORV baiting in Northeastern Ohio in August 2012. The focus of this investigation will be to ensure that public health programs are in place to capture events of human and domestic animal bait contact, ensure appropriate protocols are in place in case of a severe adverse event from a bait contact, and evaluate whether the AdRG vaccine bait matrix is associated with a different human detection rate compared to bait types used for distributing VRG.

Small bowel feeding compared to gastric feeding was associated with reduced risk of pneumonia (risk ratio [RR] 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55, 0.90; P = 0.004; I2 = 0%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53, 0.89; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%), with no difference in mortality (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90, 1.29; P = 0.43; I2 = 0%), length of ICU stay (WMD -0.57; 95%CI -1.79, 0.66; P = 0.37; I2 = 0%), duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD -1.01; 95%CI -3.37, 1.35; P = 0.40; I2 = 17%), gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.56, 1.42; P = 0.64; I2 = 0%), aspiration (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.52, 1.65; P = 0.79; I2 = 0%), and vomiting (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.53, 1.54; P = 0.72; I2 = 57%).

Methods We conducted a prospective observational study at Mulago National Referral Teaching Hospital in Uganda. We included medical and surgical ward patients over 18 years old, excluding patients discharged the day of enrolment, obstetrical patients, and patients who self-discharged prior to study completion. Over a 72-hour study period, we collected demographic and vital signs, and calculated MEWS; at 7-days we measured outcomes.

A wide repertoire of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes is present in K. pneumoniae genomes, which can constitute extra challenges in the treatment of infections caused by some strains. K. pneumoniae Kp13 is a multidrug-resistant strain responsible for causing a large nosocomial outbreak in a teaching hospital located in Southern Brazil. Kp13 produces K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-2) but is unrelated to isolates belonging to ST 258 and ST 11, the main clusters associated with the worldwide dissemination of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. In this report, we perform a genomic comparison between Kp13 and each of the following three K. pneumoniae genomes: MGH 78578, NTUH-K2044 and 342. We have completely determined the genome of K. pneumoniae Kp13, which comprises one chromosome (5.3 Mbp) and six plasmids (0.43 Mbp). Several virulence and resistance determinants were identified in strain Kp13. Specifically, we detected genes coding for six beta-lactamases (SHV-12, OXA-9, TEM-1, CTX-M-2, SHV-110 and KPC-2), eight adhesin-related gene clusters, including regions coding for types 1 (fim) and 3 (mrk) fimbrial adhesins. The rmtG plasmidial 16S rRNA methyltransferase gene was also detected, as well as efflux pumps belonging to five different families. Mutations upstream the OmpK35 porin-encoding gene were evidenced, possibly affecting its expression.

CPS production is driven mostly by the expression of genes located in a locus called cps, and the resulting structure is used to distinguish between different serotypes (K types). In this study, we report the unique genetic organization of the cps cluster from K. pneumoniae Kp13, a clinical isolate recovered during a large outbreak of nosocomial infections that occurred in a Brazilian teaching hospital. A pyrosequencing-based approach showed that the cps region of Kp13 (cpsKp13) is 26.4 kbp in length and contains genes common, although not universal, to other strains, such as the rmlBADC operon that codes for L-rhamnose synthesis. cpsKp13 also presents some unique features, like the inversion of the wzy gene and a unique repertoire of glycosyltransferases. In silico comparison of cpsKp13 RFLP pattern with 102 previously published cps PCR-RFLP patterns showed that cpsKp13 is distinct from the C patterns of all other K serotypes. Furthermore, in vitro serotyping showed only a weak reaction with capsular types K9 and K34. We confirm that K9 cps shares common genes with cpsKp13 such as the rmlBADC operon, but lacks features like uge and Kp13-specific glycosyltransferases, while K34 capsules contain three of the five sugars that potentially form the Kp13 CPS.

Many K. pneumoniae infections can only be treated when resorting to last-line drugs such as polymyxin B (PB). However, resistance to this antibiotic is also observed, although insufficient information is described on its mode of action as well as the mechanisms used by resistant bacteria to evade its effects. We aimed to study PB resistance and the influence of abiotic stresses in a clinical K. pneumoniae strain using whole transcriptome profiling. We sequenced 12 cDNA libraries of K. pneumoniae Kp13 bacteria, from two biological replicates of the original strain Kp13 (Kp13) and five derivative strains: induced high-level PB resistance in acidic pH (Kp13pH), magnesium deprivation (Kp13Mg), high concentrations of calcium (Kp13Ca) and iron (Kp13Fe), and a control condition with PB (Kp13PolB). Our results show the involvement of multiple regulatory loci that differentially respond to each condition as well as a shared gene expression response elicited by PB treatment, and indicate the participation of two-regulatory components such as ArcA-ArcB, which could be involved in re-routing the K. pneumoniae metabolism following PB treatment. Modules of co-expressed genes could be determined, which correlated to growth in acid stress and PB exposure. We hypothesize that polymyxin B induces metabolic shifts in K. pneumoniae that could relate to surviving against the action of this antibiotic.

Eighty-three clinical isolates initially identified as carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were collected from nosocomial infections in southeast Brazil. After RAPD screening, the KPC-142 isolate, showing the most divergent DNA pattern, was selected for complete genome sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Reads were assembled into scaffolds, gaps between scaffolds were resolved by in silico gap filling and extensive bioinformatics analyses were performed, using multiple comparative analysis tools and databases. Genome sequencing allowed to correct the classification of the KPC-142 isolate as K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae.

Feeding is required for the initial mosquito contact with the virus and these events are highly dependent. Addressing this relationship, we re-interrogated datasets of virus-infected mosquitoes with two different diet schemes (fed and unfed mosquitoes), evaluating the metabolic cross-talk during both processes. We constructed co-expression networks with the differentially expressed genes of these comparison: virus-infected versus blood-fed mosquitoes and virus-infected versus unfed mosquitoes. Our analysis identified one module with 110 genes that correlated with infection status (representing ~0.7% of the Ae. aegypti genome). Furthermore, we performed a machine-learning approach and summarized the infection status using only four genes (AAEL012128, AAEL014210, AAEL002477 and AAEL005350). While three of the four genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins, AAEL012128 gene is a membrane amino acid transporter correlated to viral envelope binding. This gene alone is able to discriminate all infected samples and thus should have a key role to discriminate viral infection in the Ae. aegypti mosquito.

Then, we investigated the involvement of miRNAs and their targets genes in human LCL using publicly available transcriptome data sets, followed by ex vivo validation.

Joint analysis identified 8 high confidence miRNAs altered (-1.5?fold change?1.5; p&lt;0.05) between cutaneous ulcers and uninfected skin. We found that the expression of miR-193b and miR-671 are greatly associated with their target genes, CD40 and TNFR, indicating an important role of these miRNAs in the expression of genes related to the inflammatory response observed in LCL. Besides, network analysis revealed that, miR-193b, miR-671 and TREM1 correlate only in patients that shows faster wound healing (up to 59 days) than in patients with longer time of cure (more than 60 days).

The objectives of this study were to determine the past and present bumble bee species richness of Oklahoma and indicate possible temporal trends. Records were gathered from museum and university collections, as well as from a field survey of 46 sites in 21 counties. Historical records indicated ten bumble bee species in Oklahoma, four of which had fewer than ten total records. Only five species have been recorded since 2000, four being found in the targeted survey: B. pensylvanicus (DeGeer), B. griseocollis (DeGeer …</div></div>|Author|Laura L Figueroa and Elizabeth A Bergey|Year|2015|Publisher|Kansas Entomological Society|Citedby|6|Eprint|', '|Title|Day/night upper thermal limits differ within Ectatomma ruidum ant colonies|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">In the tropics, daily temperature fluctuations can pose physiological challenges for ectothermic organisms, and upper thermal limits may affect foraging activity over the course of the day.

PTSD is moderately heritable, but few specific molecular variants accounting for this heritability have been identified. Genes regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, such as corticotrophin-releasing hormone type 1 receptor gene (CRHR1), have been implicated in traumatic-stress related phenotypes but have yet to be studied in relation to PTSD. The present study sought to examine the relation between 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRHR1 gene and posttraumatic stress symptoms in a prospective study of pediatric injury patients (n = 103) who were first assessed in the acute aftermath of their injury at the hospital. Results indicated that multiple SNPs were associated with acute symptoms at a univariate level, and after correction for multiple testing, rs12944712 was significantly related to acute PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal latent growth curve analyses suggest that rs12944712 is also related to both acute symptom level and trajectory of symptoms over time. The present study adds support for the role of CRHR1 in the stress response following potentially traumatic event exposure in youth. It should be noted that the sample size in this study was small, and therefore statistical power was low; following, results from this study should be considered preliminary. Although results are not definitive, the findings from this study warrant future replication studies on how variation in this gene relates to response to traumatic event exposure in youth.</div></div>|Author|Ananda B Amstadter and Nicole R Nugent and Bao-Zhu Yang and Alisa Miller and Richie Siburian and Priya Moorjani and Stephen Haddad and Aditi Basu and Jesen Fagerness and Glenn Saxe and Jordan W Smoller and Karestan C Koenen|Year|1970|Publisher|Hindawi|Citedby|84|Eprint|https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2011/928497.pdf', '|Title|The efficacy of initial hydrocortisone administration at preventing posttraumatic distress in adult trauma patients: a randomized trial|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><b>Objective/Introduction</b><div class=""gsh_csp"">Secondary pharmacological interventions have shown promise at reducing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS) in preclinical studies.

Unlike acoustic instruments, digital musical instruments have no coupling between the sound generation system and the physical interface with which the performer interacts. As a result of this, such instruments also lack the direct physical feedback to the performer which is present in an acoustic instrument. In fact in contrast to acoustic musical instruments, haptic and vibrotactile feedback is generally not present in a DMI contributing to a poor feel for the instrument. The main goal of this thesis is to propose ways to improve the overall feel of digital musical instruments through the study and design of its physical interface: the instrument body, sensors and feedback actuators.

However, the value and appeal of mobile TV broadcasts can be increased by the addition of a haptic-feedback channel to supplement the traditional video and audio streams. This paper discusses the development of mobile haptic TV systems. It describes the design constraints for these systems and presents one concept implementation, UltraTV. UltraTV is a mobile device that provides mid-air, multi-point, back-of-device ultrasonic haptic feedback to enhance the mobile TV experience (see Figure 1). The paper concludes with a look at avenues for further exploration within the realm of mobile haptic TV.</div></div></div>|Author|Jason Alexander and Mark T Marshall and Sriram Subramanian|Year|2011|Publisher|ACM|Citedby|45|Eprint|', '|Title|Gesture control of sound spatialization for live musical performance|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">This paper presents the development of methods for gesture control of sound spatialization.

This complexity results in a loss of liveness and possibly a poor experience for the audience. Our approach, called Rouages, is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application. Rouages reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifying musicians\' gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representing the sound compo- nents with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing the impact of musicians\' gestures on these components. In its current implementation, it focuses on MIDI controllers as input devices.

By empowering cultural heritage professionals with a technological platform to help them create their own interactive, smart, and tangible exhibitions, meSch aims at making the encounter of digital and material more sustainable in museums. At the same time, it favors the creation of a do-it-yourself community that shares experiences and learns, grows, and develops over time, inspired by concurrent developments in new technology.

We use ubiquitous computing to create reactive spaces and smart objects that seamlessly blend with the surroundings or the exhibition and bridge the gap between the physical and the digital. The technology is intentionally concealed to bring places and stories from the past into the present and create immersive experiences where technology complements heritage (as opposed to compete with it for visitors’ attention). The full integration of technology with the exhibition or heritage requires approaching the design of the visitors’ experience as a collaborative project that combines curatorial, technical and design aspects. As a multi-expertise team, we created, implemented, and evaluated thee concepts: an evocative experience in the trenches and camp of World War I in the Italian Alps; an interactive layer to tell the personal stories of those involved in the changes in The Hague during the Nazi occupation; and a set of multimedia installations to enrich a permanent collection of World War I artillery.

To more accurately capture the information of goodwill write-offs, the authors first create a model to estimate expected impairments.

By avoiding debt covenants, firms prevent creditors from taking actions to reduce bankruptcy risk and recover their investment, and allow the firm to continue operating for the benefit of equity holders. We find that a Delaware court ruling that imposed fiduciary duties toward creditors led to a decrease in financial engineering and debt-covenant avoidance in Delaware firms.

Using new proxies for the extent of financial risk management in non-financial firms we find that treated firms reduce their financial hedging, in a difference-in-difference framework. The reduction is concentrated in firms with higher conflicts of interests, such as a high CEO equity ownership level, which exposes them to more idiosyncratic risk, and a higher occurrence of option backdating. We reject the hypothesis that newly majority-independent boards reduce financial hedging due to a lack of knowledge. First, we find no difference in financial hedging for firms where SOX mandated the addition of a financial expert relative to those that already had such expertise. Second, shareholder value increases more during the period of time of the listing rule deliberations for treated firms that hedge prior to the treatment. We conclude that some firms hedge too much reducing shareholder value potentially to the benefit of under-diversified CEOs. We also show that board independence serves to reinforce monitoring which allows boards to cut back on excessive financial hedging.</div></div></div>|Author|Sterling Huang and Urs Peyer and Benjamin Segal|Year|2013|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2344&context=soa_research']"

Although recent experiments in animal models provide compelling empirical support for this idea, studies in humans have focused largely on how competitive interactions drive changes in testosterone concentrations and not how these changes influence subsequent behavior. In this paper, we provide a review of the literature on testosterone and human aggression with a main focus on the role of testosterone dynamics in modulating reactive aggression. We also speculate on one putative neural mechanism through which testosterone may bias human aggressive behavior.

In response to 1 h of restraint stress, NH rats increased locomotor activity and dopamine (DA) levels, but neonatally isolated (ISO) rats did not. Both groups had increased plasma corticosterone levels in response to restraint, but corticosterone levels were higher in ISO than in NH. Brain allopregnanolone (3?,5?-THP) levels also increased in response to stress, but NH and ISO did not differ. Sex of the rats was not a factor for any of the measures except plasma corticosterone levels, where females had higher levels than males.

Furthermore, observers\' estimates of aggression from emotionally neutral faces are accurate and are highly correlated with the facial width-to-height ratio. We investigated whether observers use the facial width-to-height ratio to estimate propensity for aggression. In experiments 1a–1c, estimates of aggression remained accurate when faces were blurred or cropped, manipulations that reduce featural cues but maintain the facial width-to-height ratio. Accuracy decreased when faces were scrambled, a manipulation that retains featural information but disrupts the facial width-to-height ratio.

Additionally, in experiment 2, a separate group of SS and CTL rats was tested on either a spatial (hippocampal?dependent) or nonspatial (nonhippocampal dependent) version of an object memory test and also were used to investigate hippocampal expression of markers of synaptic plasticity.

Therefore, the present study was undertaken to explore the effects of both prenatal protein malnutrition and neonatal isolation stress on hypothalamic and hippocampal functioning in infant rats. Specifically, we assessed the levels of plasma corticosterone, as well as dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus in rat pups that had been prenatally malnourished (6% casein diet) and isolated from nest, dam, and siblings for 1 h daily during postnatal days (PND) 2 through 8.

Paced mating, in which the female controls the timing of sexual contacts with the male, is particularly effective at eliciting acute increases in progesterone (P) and 5?-Androstane-3?, 17?-diol (3?-Diol). Interestingly, restraint stress produces comparable increases in P and 3?-Diol levels, as well as increases in corticosterone (CORT) levels. In this study, we explored the possibility that paced mating would be associated with increased CORT, in conjunction with mating-induced increases in P and 3?-Diol. Ovariectomized rats primed with estradiol benzoate (10 ?g in oil SC) and P (0.5 mg in oil s.c.) received a single ejaculatory series from males in paced or non-paced mating tests.

Terraces occur in several slope positions and diverted and slowed runoff, to build up planting surfaces that could maximize soil moisture.

One argues for the presence of strongly centralized decision-making structures associated with control over aspects of the economy, including arable land and water (eg, Brumfiel and Earle 1987a; Earle 1997; Mann 1986). A second approach, advocated by some cultural ecologists (eg, Netting 1968, 1993) and economic anthropologists (eg, Chayanov 1986; Sahlins 1972), has offered models highlighting the decision-making capacity of individual households, or"" farmsteads."" While both approaches have much to recommend them, and though they may seem antithetical, they in fact view the control and management of natural resources through opposite ends of the same spyglass. Both views argue for a strictly vertical organization of the decision-making process. The former privileges a central political authority atop a hierarchically arranged power structure. The latter, however, favors individual farming households whose surplus production is distributed throughout the rest of a community, often through elite-sponsored or controlled mechanisms such as markets and tribute. We suggest that neither top-down nor bottom-up approaches such as these are adequate for grasping the complexity of ancient political and agricultural landscapes. Ideally, an examination of ancient subsistence and political organization should enable the identification of both the technical skill and knowledge required to farm highly diverse local conditions, and the explication of relationships between a site core …</div></div></div>|Author|Jon B Hageman and Jon C Lohse|Year|2003|Publisher|University of Arizona Press|Citedby|25|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Hageman/publication/259459179_Heterarchy_Corporate_Groups_and_Late_Classic_Resource_Management_in_Northwestern_Belize/links/54ac4f4b0cf2479c2ee7b5cf/Heterarchy-Corporate-Groups-and-Late-Classic-Resource-Management-in-Northwestern-Belize.pdf', '|Title|An integrated assessment of archaeobotanical recovery methods in the Neotropical rainforest of northern Belize: flotation and dry screening|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">This report presents results of a study examining the ancient use of plants at four Late Classic (CE 600-900) Maya rural farmsteads in northwestern Belize.

While scholars have addressed this trepidation for writing faculty (see Warnock; Hewett and Ehmann), this hesitancy can be compounded for faculty across the disciplines who seek to transform both content and writing assignments from the physical to the digital classroom. Online course management systems (CMS) can hinder this task because these systems employ teacher-centered rather than participatory models (Palmquist 406). In addition, developing online courses requires that faculty modify their current pedagogy, often while continuing to juggle their face-to-face courses. Even for seasoned faculty, preparing and delivering an online course can be time-consuming, taking three times as long as a F2F course (Palloff and Pratt 74). In “Online Teaching and Classroom Change: The Trans-classroom Teacher in the Age of the Internet,” Susan Lowes calls teachers who are transitioning from F2F to online instruction “trans-classroom teachers,” likening them to immigrants “leav [ing] the familiarity of the face-to-face classroom for the uncharted terrain of the online environment, whose constraints and affordances often lead to very different practices.” The immigrant metaphor is apt, as instructors transitioning to digital culture must adapt to new problems, behaviors, languages, attitudes, and identities.

Instructors often make assumptions that their students\' are familiar with technology, even though students may be hesitant to use technology in the classroom. This dissertation gathers data from one university class and two community college classes to study students\' perceptions of and use of technology, particularly the Blackboard content management system (CMS), in the critical pedagogy classroom. In particular, it studies students\' use of technology to reflect on their own work and engage in dialogue with classmates and the instructor. The evidence suggests that students use technology and media cautiously in the classroom and will revert to more traditional forms of expression (eg, the linear essay) when they feel uncomfortable using technology or they …</div></div></div>|Author|Heidi A Skurat Harris|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|', '|Title|Immersion, Reflection, Failure: Teaching Graduate Students to Teach Writing Online|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A common challenge facing those who prepare graduate students to teach writing online is the need to help those students connect online writing instruction (OWI) theory with their classroom practice.

Much like JoAnn Beard\'s The Boys of My My Youth, the essays hold up pieces of my life for inspection and puts them down again, not always with a sense of resolution. The subtext of the piece revolves around the search to put together the pieces of what my life was before and after my mother, and the transition from girlhood to adulthood with the absence of my mother. I hope also to explore how the self splits after a traumatic death, and the desperate attempt at recreation that takes the place of genuine mourning. The final three pieces are a trilogy exploring my father\'s deteriorating health and my attempts to connect with him while somehow recapturing the self that I lost.</div></div>|Author|Heidi A Skurat Harris|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|']"

Many of these treasures were found in association with tenth-to-twelfth century Chinese export ceramics, and formal similarities with objects from other Southeast Asian cultures affirm regional affinities and inter-island trade networks that flourished in the region before there was regular contact with the Western world. Adornments of elite individuals and the deities they adored include a spectacular array of golden sashes, necklaces, pectorals, diadems, earrings, finger rings, and arm and leg ornaments. The book situates these objects within the context of early Southeast Asian history. In the first chapter, Floriana H. Capistrano-Baker outlines the history of the collection and presents an overview of the objects according to over-lapping categories of form, function, technology, and geographic provenance. In the second chapter, John Miksic explains how the collection contributes to a reassessment of the prehistory of Southeast Asia. Miksic notes the persistence of indigenous forms and the localization of imported traditions, and discusses the correlation between burial practices and social organization and suggests that the removal of gold objects from circulation through ritual burial is an indicator of non-hereditary leadership. Chapter 3, John Guy examines the meaning and metamorphosis of forms in comparison with related material recovered in the region.

Moorehead’s 1891–1892 excavation at the Hopewell Mound Group near Chillicothe, Ohio and housed at the Field Museum. Our five primary goals were to: 1) Enhance access to these legacy collections; 2) Use modern web technologies to integrate and present data to a wide audience; 3) Build from the knowledge-base of senior scholars with intimate knowledge of Ohio Hopewell Collections; 4) Promote research and help educate the public about Ohio Hopewell archaeology; and 5) Help foster the next generation of Hopewell scholars. We completed our 12-month collaboration in December 2015 and the resulting website (hopewell. unl. edu) launched in July of 2016. We hope this collaborative project will advance research by aggregating these data and providing open access to legacy and contemporary archaeological information on the ceremonial activities of the Ohio Hopewell, specifically the creation of mound complexes (eg, Mound City, Hopewell, Seip, Hopeton, Fort Ancient, and Newark).</div></div></div>|Author|Carrie Heitman and William Parkinson and Krystal Britt and Jamie Kelly and Karin Dalziel and Jessica Dussault|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|']"

Examining the state of Tennessee as a case study, the authors collected data on the board composition of publicly traded corporations and compared those data to an original study conducted in 1995. Data indicate only a modest improvement in board diversity.

Based on a survey of owner/operators, results suggest that experienced entrepreneurs, while more opportunity driven and able to leverage resources, placed less emphasis on a proactive orientation. Differences in emphasis on aspects of entrepreneurial marketing were found based on owner/operator motivations and means of business acquisition.

Using self-referencing H+-selective microelectrodes to measure extracellular H+ fluxes, we show that activation of retinal Müller (glial) cells of the tiger salamander by micromolar concentrations of extracellular ATP induces a pronounced extracellular H+ flux independent of bicarbonate transport. ADP, UTP and the non-hydrolyzable analog ATP?s at micromolar concentrations were also potent stimulators of extracellular H+ fluxes, but adenosine was not. The extracellular H+ fluxes induced by ATP were mimicked by the P2Y1 agonist MRS 2365 and were significantly reduced by the P2 receptor blockers suramin and PPADS, suggesting activation of P2Y receptors. Bath-applied ATP induced an intracellular rise in calcium in Müller cells; both the calcium rise and the extracellular H+ fluxes were significantly attenuated when calcium re-loading into the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by thapsigargin and when the PLC-IP3 signaling pathway was disrupted with 2-APB and U73122. The anion transport inhibitor DIDS also markedly reduced the ATP-induced increase in H+ flux while SITS had no effect.

One group attempted to monitor extracellular changes in H+ from isolated horizontal cells using the pH-sensitive dye 5-hexadecanoylamino-fluorescein (HAF); depolarization of horizontal cells resulted in an extracellular acidification, consistent with the H+ hypothesis of lateral inhibition.

Laser-scanning confocal microscopy revealed that HAF was not exclusively isolated to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane as previously assumed, but instead was found to be present extensively throughout the intracellular compartment.

An earlier proof that the Sivers asymmetry vanishes because of time-reversal invariance is invalidated by the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field in the operator definition of parton densities. Instead, the time-reversal argument shows that the Sivers asymmetry is reversed in sign in hadron-induced hard processes (e.g., Drell–Yan), thereby violating naive universality of parton densities.

We investigate the signatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the delay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object locations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate interferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including the largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements. These wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes impact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most desirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a dipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array observations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the largest …</div></div></div>|Author|Nithyanandan Thyagarajan and Daniel C Jacobs and Judd D Bowman and N Barry and AP Beardsley and G Bernardi and F Briggs and RJ Cappallo and P Carroll and BE Corey and A de Oliveira-Costa and Joshua S Dillon and D Emrich and Aaron Ewall-Wice and L Feng and R Goeke and LJ Greenhill and BJ Hazelton and JN Hewitt and Natasha Hurley-Walker and M Johnston-Hollitt and DL Kaplan and JC Kasper and Han-Seek Kim and P Kittiwisit and E Kratzenberg and E Lenc and J Line and A Loeb and CJ Lonsdale and MJ Lynch and B McKinley and SR McWhirter and DA Mitchell and MF Morales and E Morgan and AR Neben and D Oberoi and AR Offringa and SM Ord and Sourabh Paul and B Pindor and JC Pober and T Prabu and P Procopio and J Riding and AEE Rogers and A Roshi and N Udaya Shankar and Shiv K Sethi and KS Srivani and R Subrahmanyan and IS Sullivan and M Tegmark and SJ Tingay and CM Trott and M Waterson and RB Wayth and RL Webster and AR Whitney and A Williams and CL Williams and C Wu and JSB Wyithe|Year|2015|Publisher|IOP Publishing|Citedby|83|Eprint|http://repository.ias.ac.in/114270/1/Thyagarajan_2015_ApJ_804_14.pdf', '|Title|Empirical covariance modeling for 21 cm power spectrum estimation: A method demonstration and new limits from early Murchison Widefield Array 128-tile data|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The separation of the faint cosmological background signal from bright astrophysical foregrounds remains one of the most daunting challenges of mapping the high-redshift intergalactic medium with the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. Advances in mapping and modeling of diffuse and point source foregrounds have improved subtraction accuracy, but no subtraction scheme is perfect. Precisely quantifying the errors and error correlations due to missubtracted foregrounds allows for both the rigorous analysis of the 21 cm power spectrum and for the maximal isolation of the “EoR window” from foreground contamination. We present a method to infer the covariance of foreground residuals from the data itself in contrast to previous attempts at a priori modeling. We demonstrate our method by setting limits on the power spectrum using a 3 h integration from the 128-tile Murchison Widefield Array.

We demonstrate and quantify the power and robustness of redundancy for scalability and precision.

We then demonstrate this mapping by analyzing power spectra with both simulated and observed data from the Murchison Widefield Array.

Our analysis suggests that the polarized structures are dominated by intrinsic emission but may also have a foreground Faraday screen component. At these wavelengths, the compactness of the MWA baseline distribution provides excellent snapshot sensitivity to large-scale structure. The observations are sensitive to diffuse polarized emission at~ 54\'resolution with a sensitivity of 5.9 mJy beam? 1 and compact polarized sources at~ 2 farcm 4 resolution with a sensitivity of 2.3 mJy beam? 1 for a subset (400 deg 2) of this field.

In this paper, we compare the outputs of multiple pipelines for the purpose of validating statistical limits cosmological hydrogen at redshifts between 6 and 12. Multiple independent data calibration and reduction pipelines are used to make power spectrum limits on a fiducial night of data. Comparing the outputs of imaging and power spectrum stages highlights differences in calibration, foreground subtraction, and power spectrum calculation.

A novel peeling scheme is used to subtract 2500 sources from the visibilities with ionospheric and beam corrections, resulting in the deepest, confusion-limited MWA image so far. The resulting spectra are found to be affected by instrumental effects, which limit the constraints that can be set on source-intrinsic spectral structure.

The synthesis of MOFs generally involves the copolymerization of organic links and metal ions in a polar solvent under mild temperatures (up to 200 uC) and autogenous pressures (up to 100 atm). Since most products can be considered kinetically driven and lie on local thermodynamic minima, factors such as solubility of the organic link and metal salt, solvent polarity, ionic strength of the medium, temperature and pressure play critical roles in determining the character of products. Indeed, slight perturbations in synthetic parameters have been the basis for the preparation of what seems to be a flood of new MOF compounds. In the spirit of this discussion we advance the following ideas and developments that we believe contribute to the maturity of the field:(I) a conceptual framework that unifies the processes involved in the designed synthesis of MOFs, and which can be extended to other materials with extended structures;(II) a thesis concerning the possible structures that may form from building blocks with various shapes;(III) important considerations for achieving the design and synthesis of frameworks in which it is possible to change chemical functionality and metrics without changing the underlying framework topology;(IV) the inevitability of porosity for designed structures and some factors affecting …</div></div></div>|Author|Nathaniel L Rosi and Mohamed Eddaoudi and Jaheon Kim and Michael O’Keeffe and Omar M Yaghi|Year|2002|Publisher|Royal Society of Chemistry|Citedby|289|Eprint|http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/pdfPublications/displayarticleeonfree.pdf', '|Title|A new peptide-based method for the design and synthesis of nanoparticle superstructures: construction of highly ordered gold nanoparticle double helices|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Left-handed gold nanoparticle double helices were prepared using a new method that allows simultaneous synthesis and assembly of discrete nanoparticles.

The background to this area of management accounting started by defining this as a routine part of the budgetary control system, hence the label ‘capital budgeting’ still used in many texts and organizations today. Investment appraisal techniques traditionally applied the principles of economics to asset replacement and expansion decisions, largely ignoring the wider context of strategy formulation and implementation; thus, non— financial factors and risk levels were not always fully appraised.

We define PMC as a set of management practices formulated to achieve an organisation’s strategic goals and shape its strategic direction. While responsibility for performance measurement has generally been seen as that of the finance function of an organisation (ICAEW, 2009), the widespread use of balanced scorecards (Kaplan and Norton, 1996) and competitor analysis (Porter, 1990) has expanded the need for more non-financial data. In some sectors such as Higher Education (HE), the strategic planning team is being tasked with addressing this need (Lerner, 1999), though research on this aspect of PMC is limited (see Seneviratne and Hoque’s Chapter 24 in this volume). What we explore in this chapter through an illustrative case study is the role of planning in relation to other parties and how that has changed over a 5-year period. Both of the authors were employed in the case organisation during the period of the study (2010–2015), during which the title, role and responsibilities of the Director of Planning (DOP) changed, so it can be seen both as a longitudinal case study and as participatory action research.

Numerous methods of dehumanizing such persons were employed during this era. Of special significance was the use of the organism metaphor, whereby the “unfit” members of society were compared to a parasite, cancer, virus, or plague infecting the social body. The use of rhetoric advancing the organism metaphor in eugenic writing is described in this paper as is the effect that such rhetoric had on the societal response to such persons.</div></div></div>|Author|Gerald Vincent O\'Brien|Year|1970|Publisher|American Association on Mental Retardation|Citedby|37|Eprint|', '|Title|Eugenics, genetics, and the minority group model of disabilities: Implications for social work advocacy|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">In the United States, genetic research, as well as policy and practice innovations based on this research, has expanded greatly over the past few decades.

Also, a disability rights movement that in many ways parallels other “minority” rights campaigns has expanded. The coexistence of these developments poses intriguing challenges for social work that the profession has yet to address in a meaningful way.

Such actions may be taken because of an employer\'s fear of contagion or the presumed response of co-workers, customers or others, fears of increased insurance costs, preexisting prejudice against gay men or intravenous drug users, and other reasons. One industrial sector where such discrimination appears to be widespread is the food-service industry. Many employers in food-service establishments believe that the known or rumored presence of an infected worker in their business will drive away customers, and result in substantial loss of revenue. Of course a major reason for this concern surrounds unsubstantiated fears of HIV contamination. The present study gauges the feelings of sixty-eight independent food-service supervisors in Illinois. It focuses specifically on the consequences that employers feel may follow in the wake of a known infected employee, the degree to which employers might take discriminating actions against persons, and the knowledge employers have of HIV contagion in the workplace. This study found that both the fear of consequences and the potential for discrimination were quite high, and significantly correlated with one another. Specific factors that employers noted as being principle sources of concern include the possible loss of customers, and the degree of disruption that might occur in the workplace resulting from a suspected case of HIV/AIDS among employees.</div></div>|Author|Gerald Vincent O\'Brien|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby||Eprint|', '|Title|Published on: May 28, 2013 ISBN-10: 0719087090 Language: English Pages: 225|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Tens of thousands of innocent persons in the US were involuntarily sterilized and forced into institutions within the course of the eugenic movement (1900–30).

In response to the growing importance of accountability in the educational process and the abundance of social networking technology and communication tools available for possible classroom use, this paper will use The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to examine the adoption of established and emerging information technology in higher education classrooms. Hence, the goal of this paper is to test theoretical explanations from UTAUT in the context of higher education through the development of a set of hypotheses predicting the conditions under which classroom technology use is likely to emerge. Data collection occurred via an online survey. The instrument was sent to business faculty members teaching face-to-face classes at a southeastern university. Our findings suggest that in the context of instructors’ use of technology for classroom purposes, the most important antecedents are performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and habit with more complex effects when gender is added as an interaction term. Results from this study will provide useful information on the frequency of use of technology, along with significant factors affecting its adoption in the classroom. Departmental leaders interested in the variations in individual faculty’s level of inclination toward technological changes would find them particularly useful.</div></div></div>|Author|Carmen C Lewis and Cherie E Fretwell and Jim Ryan and James B Parham|Year|1970|Publisher|Sciedu Press. 1120 Finch Avenue West Suite 701-309, Toronto Ontario, Canada M3J 3H7|Citedby|93|Eprint|https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1067507.pdf', '|Title|Soft innovation as data-driven process improvement exploited via integrated hospital information systems|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Soft innovations are regarded as insightful, useful ideas originating from stakeholders within the organization.

The most recent gene identified, TMEM43, causes disease due to a missense mutation in a non-desmosomal gene (p.S358L) in 15 extended families from Newfoundland, Canada. To determine whether mutations in TMEM43 cause ARVC/D and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in other populations, we fully re-sequenced TMEM43 on 143 ARVC/D probands (families) from the UK and 55 probands (from 55 families) from Newfoundland.</div> <h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Methods and results</h3> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Bidirectional sequencing of TMEM43 …</div></div></div>|Author|Annika FM Haywood and Nancy D Merner and Kathy A Hodgkinson and Jim Houston and Petros Syrris and Valerie Booth and Sean Connors and Antonios Pantazis and Giovanni Quarta and Perry Elliott and William McKenna and Terry-Lynn Young|Year|2012|Publisher|Oxford University Press|Citedby|25|Eprint|https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/34/13/1002/485100', '|Title|Profound, prelingual nonsyndromic deafness maps to chromosome 10q21 and is caused by a novel missense mutation in the Usher syndrome type IF gene PCDH15|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">We studied a consanguineous family (Family A) from the island of Newfoundland with an autosomal recessive form of prelingual, profound, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss.

In particular, for a given angular dependence, the decay is always exponential—there are no power law tails at late times. In terms of the AdS-CFT correspondence, a large black hole corresponds to an approximately thermal state in the field theory, and the decay of the scalar field corresponds to the decay of a perturbation of this state.

Acceleration horizons seem to be more analogous to extreme than nonextreme black holes, since we find evidence that their horizon area is not related to the total entropy.</div></div></div>|Author|Stephen W Hawking and Gary T Horowitz|Year|1996|Publisher|IOP Publishing|Citedby|624|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9501014', '|Title|Self-interaction and gauge invariance|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">A simple unified closed form derivation of the non-linearities of the Einstein, Yang-Mills and spinless (e.g. chiral) meson systems is given.

They contribute to a better understanding of how individuals and groups commemorate their pasts, and how nostalgia plays a role in the process of remembering.</div></div>|Author|Olivia Angé and David Berliner|Year|2014|Publisher|Berghahn Books|Citedby|53|Eprint|', '|Title|Recombinant technology and new geographies of association|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Forms of social organization trade on the illusion of permanence while constantly renegotiating their relationships; their stability rests in part on their ability for transformation. The global state system is a famously reified form of social organization, its defining doctrinal characteristic of state sovereignty based on an increasingly anachronistic single-point perspective (Ruggie 1993: 159). Today the social ordering functions of state sovereignty are under duress, global issues exist beyond the control of any one state, and the global political system is undergoing a significant transformation. Global political space is increasingly defined by networks that operate fluidly; enhance flows of money, people, commodities, ideas, and weapons; and accelerate trends. At the core of this oft-noted phenomenon of spatio-temporal compression is the co-evolution of organizational forms with interactive technologies (IT), a process that rearranges the ways firms produce, states fight wars, and people structure their lives. Changes to the organization of global political space are symbiotically linked to the emergence of new organizational forms of our epoch. These forms, whether benign or malevolent, reflect a shift from the hierarchical, bureaucratic concept of “mass”(mass production, mass media) to distributed, networked forms of production and communication. It is within this shift that the bones of the sovereign state system creak while trying to regulate transborder flows with institutions evolved to regulate life within territorial borders And it is within this shift that nonstate organizations (of all kinds) emerge to reterritorialize transborder flows in various ways (Sassen …</div></div></div>|Author|Jonathan Bach and David Stark|Year|1970|Publisher|Princeton University Press|Citedby|37|Eprint|http://www.columbia-coi.com/media/papers/bach_stark_rtnga.pdf', '|Title|The new spirit of German geopolitics|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This article explores how geopolitics, in various forms, became and remains central to Germany’s self-conception.

This holds out the prospect of opening up new geopolitical perspectives, where a ‘new geopolitics’ will be an attempt to ‘re-position’Germany within an international system whose marks are set by globalization and its privileging of the temporal over the spatial.

In recent decades, Shenzhen has transformed from an experimental site for economic reform into a dominant city at the crossroads of the global economy. The first of China’s special economic zones, Shenzhen is today a UNESCO City of Design and the hub of China’s emerging technology industries. Bringing China studies into dialogue with urban studies, the contributors explore how the post-Mao Chinese appropriation of capitalist logic led to a dramatic remodeling of the Chinese city and collective life in China today. These essays show how urban villages and informal institutions enabled social transformation through cases of public health, labor, architecture, gender, politics, education, and more. Offering scholars and general readers alike an unprecedented look at one of the world’s most dynamic metropolises, this collective history uses the urban case study to explore critical problems and possibilities relevant for modern-day China and beyond.</div></div>|Author|Mary Ann O\'Donnell and Winnie Wong and Jonathan Bach|Year|2017|Publisher|University of Chicago Press|Citedby|14|Eprint|', '|Title|Technology and Transformation: facilitating knowledge networks in Eastern Europe|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This paper examines the co-evolution of interactive technology and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Eastern Europe.

Jonathan Bach and David Stark explore how organizations of civil society can be a source of organizational and technological innovation necessary for their societies’ continuous adaptability in a fast-changing global economy. They argue that NGOs can enhance their use of new technologies to go beyond their existing roles as safety nets (mitigating the social problems of emerging market economies) and as safety valves (giving voice to underrepresented social groups in the newly competitive polities).

How do ordinary people encounter what remains? In this ethnography, Jonathan Bach examines the afterlife of East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, as things and places from that vanished socialist past continue to circulate and shape the politics of memory. What Remains traces the unsettling effects of these unmoored artifacts on the German present, arguing for a rethinking of the role of the everyday as a site of reckoning with difficult pasts. Bach juxtaposes four sites where the stakes of the everyday appear: products commodified as nostalgia, amateur museums dedicated to collecting everyday life under socialism, the"" people\'s palace"" that captured the national imagination through its destruction, and the feared and fetishized Berlin Wall. Moving from the local, the intimate, and the small to the national, the impersonal, and the large, this book\'s interpenetrating chapters show the unexpected social and political force of the ordinary in the production of memory. What Remains offers a unique vantage point on the workings of the everyday in situations of radical discontinuity, contributing to new understandings of postsocialism and the intricate intersection of material remains and memory.</div></div>|Author|Jonathan Bach|Year|2017|Publisher|Columbia University Press|Citedby|6|Eprint|http://www.publicseminar.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Bach.pdf', '|Title|Consuming Communism|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Ostalgie is perhaps the most high profile case regarding the phenomena of sympathetic sentiments for the vanished socialist republics of Central and Eastern Europe.

It argues that the recent increase in the extension of political rights began as a restorative exercise for citizens regarded as disenfranchised for various reasons, and that this is in keeping with the classic expansion of rights within the traditional model of the democratic nation-state. This reinforces, rather than challenges, the principles of the sovereign state system. However, the paper then argues that citizens abroad have distinctive characteristics that complicate core conceptions of the nationstate: defining the scope of membership, signifying belonging, and negotiating rights and obligations. Because of this, the extension of the franchise does potentially add a transformative dimension to discussions about political community, national identity, and citizenship. Fieldwork in these three areas could constitute the core of an emerging research program into the possible transformational effects on the nation-state resulting from extending political rights to citizens abroad.</div></div></div>|Author|Jonathan Bach|Year|2011|Publisher||Citedby|4|Eprint|https://milanoschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bach_2011-02.pdf', '|Title|Power, secrecy, paranoia: technologies of governance and the structure of rule|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This essay concerns paranoia\'s apocalyptic implications when harnessed by the state.

About 43% of China’s total investment goes towards infrastructure, or roughly $2.3 trillion. This amounts to 14% of gross domestic product (GDP), in comparison with about 2% spent by the United States (Zhang and Barnett 2014). This investment is reflected in the massive and seemingly endless major infrastructural projects that embody Chinese state power: the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s most extensive high-speed rail network, longest cross-sea bridge, Asia’s largest train station, biggest hydroelectric project, etc. In less spectacular ways, it is reflected in the role that infrastructure plays at the heart of fiscal, legal, and public transformations at all levels in the seemingly permanent reforming of Chinese economy and society.

The concerns about united German strength, voiced once at high levels by Margaret Thatcher (or more precisely, Nicholas Ridley) among others, have tapered off, and the academic literature on Germany today focuses heavily, and valuably, on showing how Germany is paradigmatic of a process of institutionalization that constrains its preferences and reshapes its interests in a multilateral fashion. 2 Thus this process happily consigns specters of German “special paths” and “Alleingänge” to history, at least under the current European constellation. This is largely true; institutionalism is not a cynical facade for eternal national interests. and Germany is not an irredentist nationalist power in European Union clothes. In its relations with Western Europe Germany has been quite successful in dispelling such fears.

In this work, we present an ongoing project for recollecting multilingual conversations with the elderly in Latin America. This project, so far, involves the combined efforts of psychogeriatricians, linguists, computer scientists, research nurses and geriatric caregivers from six institutions across USA, Canada, Mexico and Ecuador. The recollections are being made available to the international research community. They consist of conversations with adults aged sixty and over, with different nationalities and socio-economic backgrounds. Conversations are recorded on video, transcribed and time-aligned. Additionally, we are in the process of receiving written texts—recent or old—authored by the participants, provided voluntarily. Each participant is recorded at least twice a year to allow longitudinal studies. Furthermore, information such as medical history, educational background, economic level, occupation, medications and treatments is being registered to aid conducting research on treatment progress and pharmacological effects. Potential studies derived from this work include speech, voice, writing, discourse, and facial and corporal expression analysis. We believe that our recollections incorporate complementary data that can aid researchers in further understanding the progression of cognitive degenerative diseases of the elderly.</div></div></div>|Author|Laura Hernandez-Dominguez and Sylvie Ratte and Boyd Davis and Charlene Pope|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1903', '|Title|Rhetorical Relations in the Speech of Alzheimer’s Patients and Healthy Elderly Subjects: An Approach from the RST|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The study is aimed to extract discourse relations patterns in conversational speech of subjects with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and adults with healthy aging processes using the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST).

On an individual level, one may think of medical malpractice law when discussing the pursuit of quality health care. Systemically, concerns about quality health care almost certainly will lead to a discussion of the high rate of medical errors recently reported. 1 If one thinks in terms of structure, the term"" quality health care"" may trigger consideration of financing issues such as the impact of cost-conscious management of medical care on the type of care received by patients. This article will focus on the latter consideration—financing issues—not because the former lack importance, but because the latter necessitates a hard look at the interaction between individuals and the health care market.

He had to go to court because various physicians, the hospital in which his daughter was a patient, the state attorney general, and the county prosecutor, among others, objected to the withdrawal of ventilator support. The New Jersey Supreme Court’s seminal ruling in 1976, authorizing the ventilator’s disconnection, transformed Ms. Quinlan into the first of three famous female figures in the law of end-of-life decision making. The most commonly recognized public images of end-of-life litigation in America since then have been those of young women lying in bed as loving family members clustered around them (Miles, 1990).

Under current Medicare regulations and other health care payers’ policies, patients must abandon the hope of curative treatment before opting for hospice services. As a result, many terminally ill patients access the services late, sometimes a few hours before death. Scholars have proposed that such a barrier to access, present in Medicare, Medicaid and other health insurers’ coverage rules, may be responsible for lower utilization of hospice services and later access to hospice services than has been proven to be beneficial to patients and their families. This problem becomes even more significant, and other barriers beside coverage rules become apparent, when considering the health care needs of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. Not only do patients in racial and ethnic minority groups access hospice late, like the general population, but they also access it in far fewer numbers. The statistics are especially stark among African-American and Hispanic patients.</div></div></div>|Author|Kathy L Cerminara and Alina M Perez|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|1|Eprint|https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=law_facarticles/', '|Title|2005-2006 National Health Law Moot Court Competition: Problem|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Plaintiff Sheila Kruzo seeks an injunction requiring Defendant Carewell Hospital System, Inc.(Carewell) to terminate the supply of artificial nutrition and hydration to Plaintiff\'s husband, John Kruzo.

Rapid advances in earth observation, using satellite technology pioneered by NASA and other space agencies, meant that, for the first time, verifiable global maps of land use and land cover were available (Loveland et al. 2000).

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change.

Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio?economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes.

We formulate these methods in terms of sequential regression multivariate imputation, which is an iterative procedure in which the missing values of each variable are randomly imputed conditionally on all the other variables in the completed data matrix.

An indirect driver operates more diffusely by altering one or more direct drivers. Global driving forces are categorized as demographic, economic, sociopolitical, cultural and religious, scientific and technological, and physical and biological. Drivers in all categories other than physical and biological are considered indirect. Important direct drivers include changes in climate, plant nutrient use, land conversion, and diseases and invasive species.

The focus on these partnerships grew in part out of despair that conventional intergovernmental diplomacy was unlikely to bear fruit in Johannesburg and that some alternative outcome was necessary to provide the summit with a positive result. But it also grew out of a deeper strategic understanding, shared not only by key summit organizers but also by a broader network of actors involved in implementing sustainable development goals. This strategic understanding of the importance of partnerships was based on a set of realizations that had emerged over recent years. In this article we offer an initial critical assessment of the partnership strategy, based largely on an examination of the partnerships that emerged from the WSSD. The analysis starts with an overview of theoretical conjectures on the role of partnerships in global governance. It then proceeds to evaluate empirically the patterns of WSSD partnership structure and country participation and the implications for effective governance. Our primary conclusions can be summarized as follows:</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">• The rationale for partnerships, in particular their comparative advantage, is underspecified, and the strategy is unlikely to be effective over time unless a more coherent understanding is developed.• The benefits of using the WSSD as a device to promote partnerships was very poorly articulated, and opportunities for more effective …</div></div></div>|Author|Liliana B Andonova and Marc A Levy|Year|1970|Publisher|Earthscan|Citedby|177|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liliana_Andonova/publication/308220373_Franchising_Global_Governance_Making_Sense_of_the_Johannesburg_Type_II_Partnerships/links/541afae90cf2218008bffb54/Franchising-Global-Governance-Making-Sense-of-the-Johannesburg-Type-II-Partnerships.pdf', '|Title|Improving the effectiveness of international environmental institutions|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Our analysis of international environmental institutions has focused on the activities of international organizations.

Our study is limited by the short time during which international activity with regard to protection of the environment has been intense, and by the limited repertoire of international responses. We look for institutional effectiveness, therefore, by seeking impacts on political processes as an intermediary step toward improving environmental quality. This is not just a case of looking where the light is brighter. For international institutions to make a difference environmentally, they must spawn political change, and therefore it is appropriate to judge them according to how well they do so. 1 Environmental protection is a political activity.

We note that while the human population has increased by 23% and the world economy has grown 153%, the human footprint has increased by just 9%. Still, 75% the planet’s land surface is experiencing measurable human pressures. Moreover, pressures are perversely intense, widespread and rapidly intensifying in places with high biodiversity.

Until recently, most scientific assessments of such risks focused on the anatomy of conceivable environmental changes themselves, while devoting relatively little attention to the ecosystems and societies the changes might endanger. Recently, however, questions about the vulnerability of social and ecological systems are emerging as a central focus of policy-driven assessments of global environmental risks. Meeting the growing demand for a deeper and more useful understanding of vulnerability to global change will require a dual strategy in which initiatives targeted on immediate assessment needs and research opportunities complement and feed into a longer term program for enhancing relevant knowledge bases …</div></div></div>|Author|William C Clark and Edward A Parson|Year|2000|Publisher|Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John F.

INC chairman Jean Ripert of France broke the deadlock last May by drafting a compromise document that requires industrialized countries to develop national emission limits and emission inventories and to report periodically on their progress, without targets or dates.

When they eventually land they can cause damage to crops, ecosystems, buildings, and human health. This phenomenon has been given the name ‘acid rain’, because often deposition occurs through mixing with precipitation, and because often the mechanism that does the damage is acidification. But ‘acid rain’has come to mean more than acid rain. The label is now used to cover the long-range transport of pollutants (whether or not deposition occurs through precipitation) that cause harm through mechanisms of either acidification or oxidization. The most important pollutants are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Both acid precipitation and long-range transport of air pollution were known long before acid rain became the subject of international controversy. The Scottish chemist Robert Angus Smith described acid rain as a consequence of high levels of coal burning in nineteenth-century England, publishing his accounts in an 1872 book (that coined the term). 1And Ibsen wrote of the foul air that travelled across the sea from Britain. But the contemporary understanding of acid rain is of more recent origin. It began in 1967, when Swedish chemist Svante Odén hypothesized that the increasing acidity in Swedish rivers and lakes was attributable to air pollution travelling from continental Europe and Britain. 2Odén called this ‘an insidious chemical war’, and warned that it would reduce fish populations, harm forests, increase plant diseases, and damage materials. 3 With …</div></div></div>|Author|Marc A Levy|Year|1970|Publisher|Oxford University Press|Citedby|78|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marc_Levy/publication/242676527_International_Co-operation_to_Combat_Acid_Rain/links/544f86d50cf29473161d892c/International-Co-operation-to-Combat-Acid-Rain.pdf', '|Title|Malaria stratification, climate, and epidemic early warning in Eritrea|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Eritrea has a successful malaria control program, but it is still susceptible to devastating malaria epidemics.

Relationships between monthly clinical malaria incidence by subzoba and monthly climate data from several sources, and with seasonal climate forecasts, were investigated.

In the early 1970s, no governments had policies in effect explicitly to reduce the emissions that lead to acid rain. Indeed, few even had scientific research programs under way to investigate the problem, and existing environmental policies to reduce ambient air pollution were probably contributing to a worsening of acid rain (through the increasing use of tall stacks). By 1980, new norms were emerging in the form of the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) in Europe and the 1980 Canada-US Memorandum of Intent (MOI). By 1991, emission reduction protocols had been concluded under the LRTAP convention, a new North American accord—the 1991 Canada-US Air Quality Agreement—had been signed, and most industrial countries had instituted acid rain control programs. New and stronger international environmental regimes had thus come into effect in both Europe and North America. 1</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">The aim of this chapter is to assess whether or not the development of two regimes, based on the 1979 LRTAP convention and the 1980 MOI, had a positive impact on the management of the acid rain problem during the 1980s, and, if so, how this impact was transmitted. The chapter begins with a brief description of the acid rain problem and the interests affected. It also lays out the policy and diplomatic responses, emphasizing the two regimes under study.</div></div></div>|Author|Don Munton and Marvin Soroos and Elena Nikitina and Marc A Levy|Year|1970|Publisher|MIT Press|Citedby|75|Eprint|', '|Title|Time for a third wave of environment and security scholarship?|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">This is an enormously positive development, and scholars in two formerly quite segregated communities are now reading each other’s work and addressing common research questions.

The most important implication is a need to explore the causes of regional conflict as an important end in itself, and to abandon the current fad of merely demonstrating links to environmental deterioration.

As future missions extend beyond low-Earth orbit, analysis of returned environmental samples becomes impractical and safety monitoring should be performed in situ. Here, we describe initial designs of a five-channel tunable laser absorption spectrometer to continuously monitor combustion products with the goal of minimal maintenance and calibration over long-duration missions. The instrument incorporates dedicated laser channels to simultaneously target strong mid-infrared absorption lines of CO, HCl, HCN, HF, and CO2. The availability of low-power-consumption semiconductor lasers operating in the 2 to 5 ?m wavelength range affords the flexibility to select absorption lines for each gas with maximum interaction strength and minimal interference from other gases, which enables the design of a compact and mechanically robust spectrometer with low-level sensitivity. In this paper, we focus primarily on absorption line selection based on the availability of low-power single-mode semiconductor laser sources designed specifically for the target wavelength range.</div></div>|Author|Ryan M Briggs and Clifford Frez and Carl E Borgentum and Mahmood Bagheri and Siamak Forouhar and Randy D May|Year|2014|Publisher|44th International Conference on Environmental Systems|Citedby|3|Eprint|https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/59623/ICES-2014-244.pdf%3Bsequence=1', '|Title|Portable 4.6 µm Laser Absorption Spectrometer for Carbon Monoxide Monitoring and Fire Detection|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">S part of the Advanced Exploration Systems Program, NASA supports the development of compact, lowpower fire detection platforms and environmental monitoring systems for the International Space Station and future missions, with the goal of tracking concentrations of particulates, acid gases, and other airborne hazards. 1 Within the Spacecraft Fire Safety Demonstration project, we have developed a laser absorption spectrometer operating at wavelengths near 4.6 µm that can be used to detect small concentrations of CO without interference from CO2, H2O, or other gases normally present in habitable environments.

One mechanism by which aerobic exercise may preserve executive function is through the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which also declines with age.

Participants were randomized to a stretching and toning control group or a moderate intensity walking intervention group. BDNF serum levels and performance on a task-switching paradigm were collected at baseline and follow-up. We found that age moderated the effect of intervention group on changes in BDNF levels, with those in the highest age quartile showing the greatest increase in BDNF after 1-year of moderate intensity walking exercise (p = .036). The mediation analyses revealed that BDNF mediated the effect of the intervention on task-switch accuracy, but did so as a function of age, such that exercise-induced changes in BDNF mediated the effect of exercise on task-switch performance only for individuals over the age of 71.

This study examined the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and recruitment of the neural circuits involved in an attentional control task in a group of healthy older adults. Employing a version of the Stroop task, we examined whether higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with an increase in activation in cortical regions responsible for imposing attentional control along with an up-regulation of activity in sensory brain regions that process task-relevant representations. Higher fitness levels were associated with better behavioral performance and an increase in the recruitment of prefrontal and parietal cortices in the most challenging condition, thus providing evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with an increase in the recruitment of the anterior processing regions. There was a top-down modulation of extrastriate visual areas that process both task-relevant and task-irrelevant attributes relative to the baseline. However, fitness was not associated with differential activation in the posterior processing regions, suggesting that fitness enhances attentional function by primarily influencing the neural circuitry of anterior cortical regions. This study provides novel evidence of a differential association of fitness with anterior and posterior brain regions, shedding further light onto the neural changes accompanying cardiorespiratory fitness.</div></div>|Author|Ruchika S Prakash and Michelle W Voss and Kirk I Erickson and Jason Lewis and Laura Chaddock and Edward Malkowski and Heloisa Alves and Jennifer S Kim and Amanda Szabo and Siobham White and Thomas Wojcicki and Arthur F Kramer and Emily L Mailey and Edward McAuley|Year|2011|Publisher|Frontiers|Citedby|110|Eprint|https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00229', '|Title|Growth trajectories of exercise self-efficacy in older adults: Influence of measures and initial status.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp""><h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Objective:</h3><div class=""gsh_csp""></div> This study examined differential trajectories of exercise-related self-efficacy beliefs across a 12-month randomized controlled exercise trial. <h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Method:</h3><div class=""gsh_csp""></div> Previously inactive older adults (N= 144; M age= 66.5) were randomly assigned to one of two exercise conditions (walking, flexibility-toning-balance) and completed measures of barriers self-efficacy (BARSE), exercise self-efficacy (EXSE), and self-efficacy for walking (SEW) across a 12-month period.

Several studies have postulated that increased regional brain volume and function are associated with aerobic fitness because of increased vascularization rather than increased neural tissue per se. We tested this position by examining the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and N?acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the right frontal cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NAA is a nervous system specific metabolite found predominantly in cell bodies of neurons. We reasoned that if aerobic fitness was predominantly influencing the vasculature of the brain, then NAA levels should not vary as a function of aerobic fitness. However, if aerobic fitness influences the number or viability of neurons, then higher aerobic …</div></div></div>|Author|Kirk I Erickson and Andrea M Weinstein and Bradley P Sutton and Ruchika Shaurya Prakash and Michelle W Voss and Laura Chaddock and Amanda N Szabo and Emily L Mailey and Siobhan M White and Thomas R Wojcicki and Edward McAuley and Arthur F Kramer|Year|2012|Publisher|Blackwell Publishing Inc|Citedby|73|Eprint|https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/brb3.30', '|Title|Non-exercise estimated cardiorespiratory fitness: associations with brain structure, cognition, and memory complaints in older adults|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div><div class=""gsh_csp"">There is increasing evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with brain structure and function, and improvements in CRF through exercise training have been associated with neural and cognitive functioning in older adults.

In neocortical areas, higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels are associated with increased gray matter volume, and these volumetric differences mediate enhanced cognitive performance in a variety of tasks. Here we examine whether cardiorespiratory fitness correlates with the volume of the subcortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia and whether this relationship predicts cognitive flexibility in older adults. Structural MRI was used to determine the volume of the basal ganglia nuclei in a group of older, neurologically healthy individuals (mean age 66 years, ?=179). Measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), cognitive flexibility (task switching), and attentional control (flanker task) were also collected. Higher fitness levels were correlated with higher accuracy rates in the Task Switching paradigm. In addition, the volume of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus positively correlated with Task Switching accuracy. Nested regression modeling revealed that caudate nucleus volume was a significant mediator of the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness, and task switching performance. These findings indicate that higher cardiorespiratory fitness predicts better cognitive flexibility in older adults through greater grey matter volume in the dorsal striatum.</div></div>|Author|Timothy D Verstynen and Brighid Lynch and Destiny L Miller and Michelle W Voss and Ruchika Shaurya Prakash and Laura Chaddock and Chandramallika Basak and Amanda Szabo and Erin A Olson and Thomas R Wojcicki and Jason Fanning and Neha P Gothe and Edward McAuley and Arthur F Kramer and Kirk I Erickson|Year|1970|Publisher|Hindawi|Citedby|64|Eprint|http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2012/939285.pdf', '|Title|Cardiorespiratory fitness, hippocampal volume, and frequency of forgetting in older adults.|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp""><h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Objective:</h3><div class=""gsh_csp""></div> The purpose of this study was to extend our earlier work to determine the extent to which cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with the frequency of memory problems via its effects on the hippocampus and spatial working memory.

The purpose of this study was to test the construct validity of a regression equation developed by Jurca and colleagues (2005) to estimate CRF without exercise testing in community dwelling older adults. Participants (n = 172) aged 60 to 80 years with no contraindications to submaximal or maximal exercise testing completed a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) and the submaximal Rockport 1-mile walk test on separate occasions. Data included in the regression equation (age, sex, body mass index, resting heart rate, and physical activity) were obtained via measurement or self-report. Participants also reported presence of cardiovascular conditions. The multiple R for the regression equation was .72, p &lt; .001 and CRF estimated from this equation was significantly correlated with the MET value from the GXT (r = 0.66) and with CRF estimated from submaximal field testing (r = 0.67). All three CRF indices were significantly and inversely associated with reporting more cardiovascular conditions.

Brain activation was measured during dual-task performance with functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 128 healthy older adults (59-80 years). Higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with greater activation during dual-task processing in several brain areas including the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex (ACC/SMA), thalamus and basal ganglia, right motor/somatosensory cortex and middle frontal gyrus, and left somatosensory cortex, controlling for age, sex, education, and gray matter volume. Of these regions, greater ACC/SMA activation mediated the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and dual-task performance.

Each shelf holds 240 kg of potato from 23 march 2013 to December 2013. Potato spoilage, sprouting, shrinkage, moisture content, vitamin C and total sugar content of potato were measured. Experimental results revealed that potato spoilage progressively increased from April to November and sprouting of potato gradually increased from June to October, but stopped in November. The cumulative spoilage and sprouting were much lower in the improved bin compared to traditional farmer’s practices. Shrinkage of potato was found higher in farmer’s practice than that of storage bin from October to November.

Direct current (DC) four-point probe potential drop technique was used in this study. Inspection was carried out by providing currents between the outer probes in the specimen to be tested and measuring the arising electrical voltage drop between two inner probes placed on its surface. The presence of a defect generally increased the resistance and hence the voltage drop was measured. However, the principle underlying these techniques is relatively simple. A metallic rod having 3.175 mm diameter covered with plastic fiber was used in each probes as conductor. Inner two probes were used to get accurate value of voltage drop as the outer probes were used for current passing. Compression springs were used between the collar and tail of the probes to keep probes on the sample rigidly during experiment. Five, ten and fifteen amperes of current were being flown from a DC source-12V battery into samples. Mild Steel (MS) flat bar (180× 25× 4 mm), Stainless Steel (SS) flat bar (180× 25× 5 mm) and Carbon Steel (CS) flat bar (180× 37.5× 4 mm) were used as materials of the agricultural machinery parts.

For resonators operating at a low pressure in hermetic wafer-scale encapsulation, the effect of each energy loss mechanism is discussed. The temperature dependence of each mechanism and their contribution to the total quality factor is investigated. MEMS resonators can be designed to have either strong or weak dependence of on temperature, which is if the effects of the temperature on the dominant loss mechanisms are well understood.

To better understand this function, we performed immuno-precipitation followed by mass-spectrometry proteomics to identify proteins interacting with the NMMHCIIA-enriched actin-myosin complexes. Computational analyses revealed that these proteins belong to functional networks including regulators of cytoskeletal organization, metabolism and networks regulated by the HIV-1 gene nef. We further characterized the subcellular localization of NMMHCIIA within podocytes in vivo, and found it to be present within the podocyte major foot processes. Finally, we tested the effect of loss of MYH9 expression in podocytes in vitro, and found that it was necessary for cytoskeletal organization.

The genetic factors predisposing to obesity are poorly understood. A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes–susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the <i>FTO</i> (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16% of adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7 years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass.</div></div></div>|Author|Timothy M Frayling and Nicholas J Timpson and Michael N Weedon and Eleftheria Zeggini and Rachel M Freathy and Cecilia M Lindgren and John RB Perry and Katherine S Elliott and Hana Lango and Nigel W Rayner and Beverley Shields and Lorna W Harries and Jeffrey C Barrett and Sian Ellard and Christopher J Groves and Bridget Knight and Ann-Marie Patch and Andrew R Ness and Shah Ebrahim and Debbie A Lawlor and Susan M Ring and Yoav Ben-Shlomo and Marjo-Riitta Jarvelin and Ulla Sovio and Amanda J Bennett and David Melzer and Luigi Ferrucci and Ruth JF Loos and Inês Barroso and Nicholas J Wareham and Fredrik Karpe and Katharine R Owen and Lon R Cardon and Mark Walker and Graham A Hitman and Colin NA Palmer and Alex SF Doney and Andrew D Morris and George Davey Smith and Andrew T Hattersley and Mark I McCarthy|Year|2007|Publisher|American Association for the Advancement of Science|Citedby|3883|Eprint|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646098/?_escaped_fragment_=po=12.5000', '|Title|Replication of genome-wide association signals in UK samples reveals risk loci for type 2 diabetes|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood.

In most cases, individual polymorphisms only moderately increase risk (~20%), and they are thought to be unhelpful in assessing individuals\' risk clinically. The value of analyzing multiple alleles simultaneously is not well studied. This is often because, for any given disease, very few common risk alleles have been confirmed.   Methods and Findings Three common variants (Lys23 of KCNJ11, Pro12 of PPARG, and the T allele at rs7903146 of TCF7L2) have been shown to predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus across many large studies. Risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.30 to 0.88 in controls. To assess the combined effect of multiple susceptibility alleles, we genotyped these variants in a large case-control study (3,668 controls versus 2,409 cases). Individual allele odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.23) to 1.48 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.60). We found no evidence of gene-gene interaction, and the risks of multiple alleles were consistent with a multiplicative model. Each additional risk allele increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 1.28 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.35) times. Participants with all six risk alleles had an OR of 5.71 (95% CI, 1.15 to 28.3) compared to those with no risk alleles.

Its aetiological agent (IPNV) was the first virus to be isolated from teleosts (Wolf et al., 1960) and the disease and the virus have been associated intimately with the development of fish and aquatic animal virology. Due to its distinct biophysical characteristics, IPN virus became the archetype of a new family of viruses, the birnaviruses, denoting its bi-segmented RNA genome (Dobos et al., 1979). Over time, numerous closely related viruses of the same family have been detected in a variety of aquatic species, but with diverse clinical manifestations. Thus, the term ‘aquatic birnaviruses’ has been used to summarize virus family members derived from aquatic animals and environments, while the term ‘IPNV’is used for aquatic birnaviruses isolated from or causing disease in salmonid species. A number of comprehensive reviews have been published on the IPN disease and its causative virus (Wolf, 1966, 1988; McAllister, 1979; Hill, 1982; Reno, 1999). During the past 10 years, research has continued, focusing on molecular markers of virulence, host–pathogen relationships, epidemiology, on the role of inducing factors in disease manifestation and on the development of new and more effective methods for its control in commercial salmonid farming. Major progress has been made in vaccination against IPN, in selective breeding and in the search for genomic markers of resistance to IPN in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout</div></div></div>|Author|Eann S Munro and Paul J Midtlyng|Year|1970|Publisher|CABI|Citedby|136|Eprint|', '|Title|Phylum myxozoa|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Myxozoans are highly specialized metazoan parasites of aquatic hosts with a very wide host range.

However, when fish are cultured in high numbers and are stressed by adverse environmental factors (e.g. heavy metal pollution, low dissolved oxygen, nutritional deficiencies, and/or overcrowding), parasites may have the advantage and the risk of disease outbreak increases in the fish population. We know very little about innate immunity against parasites. Hence it has not been considered a viable strategy to protect fish from diseases.

This method has been widely applied to characterize the micro-scale stiffness for a variety of materials ranging from metal surfaces to soft biological tissues and cells. The basic principle of this method is to indent a cell with an AFM tip of selected geometry and measure the applied force from the bending of the AFM cantilever.

Viral infection in plants induces a potent and highly specific antiviral RNA silencing response characterized by the formation of virus-derived siRNAs. Arabidopsis thaliana has ten AGO genes of which AGO1, AGO2, and AGO7 have been shown to play roles in antiviral defense. A genetic analysis was used to identify and characterize the roles of AGO proteins in antiviral defense against Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in Arabidopsis. AGO1, AGO2 and AGO10 promoted anti-TuMV defense in a modular way in various organs, with AGO2 providing a prominent antiviral role in leaves. AGO5, AGO7 and AGO10 had minor effects in leaves. AGO1 and AGO10 had overlapping antiviral functions in inflorescence tissues after systemic movement of the virus, although the roles of AGO1 and AGO10 accounted for only a minor amount of the overall antiviral activity. By combining AGO protein immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing of associated small RNAs, AGO2, AGO10, and to a lesser extent AGO1 were shown to associate with siRNAs derived from silencing suppressor (HC-Pro)-deficient TuMV-AS9, but not with siRNAs derived from wild-type TuMV.

Highly malignant renal carcinoma cancer cells fail to form <i>in vivo</i> tumors in the absence of ADAM17, confirming the essential function of this molecule in tumorigenesis. These data show that …</div></div></div>|Author|Aleksandra Franovic and Isabelle Robert and Karlene Smith and Ghada Kurban and Arnim Pause and Lakshman Gunaratnam and Stephen Lee|Year|2006|Publisher|American Association for Cancer Research|Citedby|73|Eprint|http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/66/16/8083.full.pdf', '|Title|Community?based approaches for prevention of mother to child transmission in resource?poor settings: a social ecological review|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <h3 class=""gsh_h3"">Introduction</h3> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Numerous barriers to optimal uptake of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services occur at community level (i.e., outside the healthcare setting).

We have assessed the kinetic properties of the murine double minute protein (MDM2) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligases in living cells under physiological conditions that alter the stability of their respective p53 and hypoxia-inducible factor substrates. Photobleaching experiments reveal that MDM2 and VHL are highly mobile proteins in settings where their substrates are efficiently degraded. The nucleolar architecture converts MDM2 and VHL to a static state in response to regulatory cues that are associated with substrate stability. After signal termination, the nucleolus is able to rapidly release these proteins from static detention, thereby restoring their high mobility profiles. A protein surface region of VHL9s ?-sheet domain was identified as a discrete [H+]-responsive nucleolar detention signal that targets the VHL/Cullin-2 …</div></div></div>|Author|Karim Mekhail and Mireille Khacho and Amanda Carrigan and Robert RJ Hache and Lakshman Gunaratnam and Stephen Lee|Year|2005|Publisher|Rockefeller University Press|Citedby|69|Eprint|http://jcb.rupress.org/content/170/5/733.full.pdf+html', '|Title|Role of exon 2-encoded ?-domain of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas frequently harbor inactivating mutations in exon 2 of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Here, we examine the effect of the loss of exon 2-encoded ?-domain function on VHL biochemical properties. Exon 2-encoded residues are required for VHL-mediated NEDD8 conjugation on cullin-2 and assembly with hypoxia-inducible factor ? (HIF?) and fibronectin. These residues are not essential for VHL ability to assemble with elongin BC/cullin-2, to display E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and to confer energy-dependent nuclear import properties to a reporter protein. Localization studies in HIF-1?-null embryonic cells suggest that exon 2-encoded ?-domain mediates transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of VHL independently of assembly with HIF-1? and oxygen concentration.

In addition to recycling between a naïve, chaperone-associated cytoplasmic complex and a liganded chaperone-free nuclear form, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been observed to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear export of GR and other nuclear receptors has been proposed to depend on direct interactions with calreticulin, which is predominantly localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that rapid calreticulin-mediated nuclear export of GR is a specific response to transient disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum that occurs during polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion.

The measurement is performed in the Z/?*? e+ e? and Z/?*? ?+ ?? channels, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb? 1. Normalized differential cross sections as a function of the Z/?* boson transverse momentum are measured for transverse momenta up to 800 GeV. The measurement is performed inclusively for Z/?* rapidities up to 2.4, as well as in three rapidity bins. The channel results are combined, compared to perturbative and resummed QCD calculations and used to constrain the parton shower parameters of Monte Carlo generators.</div></div>|Author|Georges Aad and Brad Abbott and Jalal Abdallah and S Abdel Khalek and O Abdinov and Rosemarie Aben and Babak Abi and Maris Abolins and OS AbouZeid and Halina Abramowicz and H Abreu and R Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and L Adamczyk and DL Adams and J Adelman and Stefanie Adomeit and T Adye and T Agatonovic-Jovin and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and M Agustoni and SP Ahlen and F Ahmadov and G Aielli and H Akerstedt and TPA Åkesson and G Akimoto and AV Akimov and GL Alberghi and J Albert and S Albrand and MJ Alconada Verzini and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and C Alexa and G Alexander and G Alexandre and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and G Alimonti and L Alio and J Alison and BMM Allbrooke and LJ Allison and PP Allport and J Almond and A Aloisio and A Alonso and F Alonso and C Alpigiani and A Altheimer and B Alvarez Gonzalez and MG Alviggi and K Amako and Y Amaral Coutinho and C Amelung and D Amidei and SP Amor Dos Santos and A Amorim and S Amoroso and N Amram and G Amundsen and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and G Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and XS Anduaga and S Angelidakis and I Angelozzi and P Anger and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and AV Anisenkov and N Anjos and A Annovi and A Antonaki and M Antonelli and A Antonov and J Antos and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and R Apolle and G Arabidze and I Aracena and Y Arai and JP Araque and ATH Arce and JF Arguin and S Argyropoulos and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and O Arnaez and V Arnal and H Arnold and M Arratia and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Asai and N Asbah and A Ashkenazi and B Åsman and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and B Auerbach and K Augsten and M Aurousseau and G Avolio and G Azuelos and Y Azuma and MA Baak and C Bacci and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and M Backhaus and J Backus Mayes and E Badescu and P Bagiacchi and P Bagnaia and Y Bai and T Bain and JT Baines and OK Baker and S Baker and P Balek and F Balli and E Banas and SW Banerjee and AAE Bannoura and V Bansal and HS Bansil and L Barak and SP Baranov and EL Barberio and D Barberis and M Barbero and T Barillari and M Barisonzi and T Barklow|Year|2014|Publisher|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Citedby|2702|Eprint|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2014)145', '|Title|Search for neutral Higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model in pp collisions at  TeV with the ATLAS detector|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">A bstract A search for the neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is reported. The analysis is performed on data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The samples used for this search were collected in 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities in the range 19.5-20.3 fb? 1. The MSSM Higgs bosons are searched for in the ? ? final state. No significant excess over the expected background is observed, and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross section times branching fraction of a scalar particle as a function of its mass. The results are also interpreted in the MSSM parameter space for various benchmark scenarios.</div></div>|Author|Georges Aad and Brad Abbott and Jalal Abdallah and S Abdel Khalek and Ovsat Abdinov and Rosemarie Aben and Babak Abi and Maris Abolins and OS AbouZeid and Halina Abramowicz and H Abreu and R Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and L Adamczyk and DL Adams and J Adelman and Stefanie Adomeit and T Adye and T Agatonovic-Jovin and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and M Agustoni and SP Ahlen and F Ahmadov and G Aielli and H Akerstedt and TPA Åkesson and G Akimoto and AV Akimov and GL Alberghi and J Albert and S Albrand and MJ Alconada Verzini and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and C Alexa and G Alexander and G Alexandre and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and G Alimonti and L Alio and J Alison and BMM Allbrooke and LJ Allison and PP Allport and A Aloisio and A Alonso and F Alonso and C Alpigiani and A Altheimer and B Alvarez Gonzalez and MG Alviggi and K Amako and Y Amaral Coutinho and C Amelung and D Amidei and SP Amor Dos Santos and A Amorim and S Amoroso and N Amram and G Amundsen and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and G Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and XS Anduaga and S Angelidakis and I Angelozzi and P Anger and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and AV Anisenkov and N Anjos and A Annovi and A Antonaki and M Antonelli and A Antonov and J Antos and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and R Apolle and G Arabidze and I Aracena and Y Arai and JP Araque and ATH Arce and FA Arduh and J-F Arguin and S Argyropoulos and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and O Arnaez and V Arnal and H Arnold and M Arratia and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Asai and N Asbah and A Ashkenazi and B Åsman and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and B Auerbach and K Augsten and M Aurousseau and G Avolio and B Axen and G Azuelos and Y Azuma and MA Baak and AE Baas and C Bacci and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and M Backhaus and J Backus Mayes and E Badescu and P Bagiacchi and P Bagnaia and Y Bai and T Bain and JT Baines and OK Baker and P Balek and F Balli and E Banas and Sw Banerjee and AAE Bannoura and V Bansal and HS Bansil and L Barak and SP Baranov and EL Barberio and D Barberis and M Barbero and T Barillari and M Barisonzi|Year|2014|Publisher|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Citedby|2595|Eprint|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2014)056', '|Title|Search for the  decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson in associated  production with the ATLAS detector|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">A search for the <svg aria-label="" b\\bar {b} "" class=""gs_fsvg"" height=""12px"" style=""vertical-align:0px;"" width=""13px""><g transform=""matrix(0.01400, 0.00000, 0.00000, 0.01400, 0.00000, 11.94823)""><path d=""M 354 -23  Q 230 -23 161 74  T 92 301  Q 92 320 101 375  T 111 444  L 309 1239  Q 317 1274 319 1294  Q 319 1327 186 1327  Q 166 1327 166 1354  Q 167 1359 170 1372  T 179 1392  T 195 1399  L 471 1421  Q 496 1421 496 1395  L 344 791  Q 460 905 578 905  Q 665 905 727 859  T 821 738  T 852 578  Q 852 479 813 373  T 707 177  T 548 32  T 354 -23  Z M 358 31  Q 428 31 489 89  T 588 221  Q 629 303 664 443  T 700 668  Q 700 741 669 796  T 573 852  Q 499 852 431 797  T 313 668  L 256 436  Q 223 307 221 229  Q 221 152 254 91  T 358 31  Z "" transform=""scale(0.48828, -0.48828)""></path><g transform=""translate(429.17001, 0.00000)""><g><path d=""M 354 -23  Q 230 -23 161 74  T 92 301  Q 92 320 101 375  T 111 444  L 309 1239  Q 317 1274 319 1294  Q 319 1327 186 1327  Q 166 1327 166 1354  Q 167 1359 170 1372  T 179 1392  T 195 1399  L 471 1421  Q 496 1421 496 1395  L 344 791  Q 460 905 578 905  Q 665 905 727 859  T 821 738  T 852 578  Q 852 479 813 373  T 707 177  T 548 32  T 354 -23  Z M 358 31  Q 428 31 489 89  T 588 221  Q 629 303 664 443  T 700 668  Q 700 741 669 796  T 573 852  Q 499 852 431 797  T 313 668  L 256 436  Q 223 307 221 229  Q 221 152 254 91  T 358 31  Z "" transform=""scale(0.48828, -0.48828)""></path></g><g transform=""translate(-35.41499, -263.44501)""><path d=""M 141 1137  V 1208  H 881  V 1137  H 141  Z "" transform=""scale(0.48828, -0.48828)""></path></g></g></g></svg> decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson is performed with the ATLAS experiment using the full dataset recorded at the LHC in Run 1.

The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.14 fb? 1. In this search, a kinematic variable ? T is used as the main discriminator between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. No excess of events over the standard model expectation is found. Exclusion limits in the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model are set. In this model, squark masses below 1.1 TeV are excluded at 95% CL Gluino masses below 1.1 TeV are also ruled out at 95% CL for values of the universal scalar mass parameter below 500

using a data sample of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. This signature is common to both dark matter and extra dimensions models. The data were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb? 1. The number of observed events is consistent with the standard model expectation. Constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross sections are determined for both spin-independent and spin-dependent interaction models. For the spin-independent model, these are the most constraining limits for a dark matter particle with mass below 3.5 GeV/c 2, a region unexplored by direct detection experiments. For the spin-dependent model, these are the most stringent constraints over the 0.1–200 GeV/c 2 mass range.

The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb? 1 and 19.4 fb? 1 collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4.3 standard deviations for m H= 125.6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m H= 125.6 GeV is 0.72_-0.18^+0.20 times the standard model expectation.

The transverse momentum balance in dijet and ?/Z+ jets events is used to measure the jet energy response in the CMS detector, as well as the transverse momentum resolution. The results are presented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-based approach, the``Jet-Plus-Track\'\'approach, which improves the measurement of calorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks, and the``Particle Flow\'\'approach, which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in the event, prior to the jet clustering, based on information from all relevant subdetectors.</div></div></div>|Author|CMS collaboration|Year|2011|Publisher|IOP Publishing|Citedby|1702|Eprint|https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/6/11/P11002/pdf', '|Title|Centrality dependence of dihadron correlations and azimuthal anisotropy harmonics in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt {s_ {NN}}= 2.76\\\\mbox {TeV} $|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Measurements from the CMS experiment at the LHC of dihadron correlations for charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at a nucleon–nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV are presented.

The observed two-dimensional correlation structure in ?<i>?</i> and ?<i>?</i> is characterised by a narrow peak at (?<i>?</i>,?<i>?</i>)?(0,0) from jet-like correlations and a long-range structure that persists up to at least |?<i>?</i>|=4. An enhancement of the magnitude of the short-range jet peak is observed with increasing centrality, especially for particles of <i>p</i> <sub>T</sub> around 1–2 GeV/<i>c</i>.

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.6 (19.7) fb? 1 for the dimuon (dielectron) channel. No evidence for non-standard-model physics is observed and 95% confidence level limits are set on parameters from a number of new physics models. The narrow resonance analyses exclude a Sequential Standard Model Z SSM? resonance lighter than 2.90 TeV, a superstring-inspired Z ?? lighter than 2.57 TeV, and Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein gravitons with masses below 2.73, 2.35, and 1.27 TeV for couplings of 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.

No significant excess in data is observed above the expectation from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of supersymmetric models with pair production of top squarks that decay either to a top quark and a neutralino or to a bottom quark and a chargino. For small mass values of the lightest supersymmetric particle, top-squark mass values up to around 650 GeV are excluded.</div></div></div>|Author|Serguei Chatrchyan and V Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and A Tumasyan and W Adam and T Bergauer and M Dragicevic and J Erö and C Fabjan and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and W Kiesenhofer and V Knünz and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and I Mikulec and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and C Rohringer and H Rohringer and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and A Taurok and W Treberer-Treberspurg and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and S Alderweireldt and M Bansal and S Bansal and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and A Knutsson and S Luyckx and L Mucibello and S Ochesanu and B Roland and R Rougny and Z Staykova and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and A Van Spilbeeck and F Blekman and S Blyweert and J D’Hondt and A Kalogeropoulos and J Keaveney and S Lowette and M Maes and A Olbrechts and S Tavernier and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Villella and C Caillol and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and L Favart and APR Gay and T Hreus and A Léonard and PE Marage and A Mohammadi and L Perniè and T Reis and T Seva and L Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and Volker Adler and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and Silvia Costantini and Sven Dildick and Guillaume Garcia and Benjamin Klein and Jeremie Lellouch and Andrey Marinov and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Dirk Ryckbosch and Michael Sigamani and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and S Walsh and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and G Bruno and R Castello and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and T Du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and P Jez and V Lemaitre and J Liao and O Militaru and C Nuttens and D Pagano and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and JM Vizan Garcia and N Beliy and T Caebergs and E Daubie and GH Hammad and GA Alves and M Correa Martins Junior and T Martins and ME Pol and MHG Souza and WL Aldá Júnior and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custódio and EM Da Costa and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and H Malbouisson and M Malek and D Matos Figueiredo and L Mundim and H Nogima and WL Prado Da Silva and A Santoro and A Sznajder and EJ Tonelli Manganote|Year|2013|Publisher|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Citedby|1201|Eprint|https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1586.pdf;', '|Title|Meta-analysis identifies 29 additional ulcerative colitis risk loci, increasing the number of confirmed associations to 47|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies in ulcerative colitis have identified 18 susceptibility loci.

We identified 29 additional risk loci (P&lt; 5× 10? 8), increasing the number of ulcerative colitis–associated loci to 47. After annotating associated regions using GRAIL, expression quantitative trait loci data and correlations with non-synonymous SNPs, we identified many candidate genes that provide potentially important insights into disease pathogenesis, including IL1R2, IL8RA-IL8RB, IL7R, IL12B, DAP, PRDM1, JAK2, IRF5, GNA12 and LSP1.

Jets are the experimental signatures of energetic quarks and gluons produced in high-energy processes. Like all experimentally-reconstructed objects, jets need to be calibrated in order to have the correct energy scale: this is the aim of the jet energy corrections (JEC). The detailed understanding of both the energy scale and the transverse momentum resolution of the jets is of crucial importance for many physics analyses, and a leading component of their associated systematic uncertainties.

The searches are sensitive to non-standard-model invisible decays of the recently observed Higgs boson, as well as additional Higgs bosons with similar production modes and large invisible branching fractions. In all channels, the observed data are consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. Limits are set on the production cross section times invisible branching fraction, as a function of the Higgs boson mass …</div></div></div>|Author|Serguei Chatrchyan and V Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and A Tumasyan and W Adam and T Bergauer and M Dragicevic and J Erö and C Fabjan and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and C Hartl and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and W Kiesenhofer and V Knünz and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and I Mikulec and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and H Rohringer and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and A Taurok and W Treberer-Treberspurg and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and S Alderweireldt and M Bansal and S Bansal and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and A Knutsson and S Luyckx and S Ochesanu and B Roland and R Rougny and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and A Van Spilbeeck and F Blekman and S Blyweert and J D’Hondt and N Heracleous and A Kalogeropoulos and J Keaveney and TJ Kim and S Lowette and M Maes and A Olbrechts and Q Python and D Strom and S Tavernier and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Villella and C Caillol and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and L Favart and APR Gay and A Léonard and PE Marage and A Mohammadi and L Perniè and T Reis and T Seva and L Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and Volker Adler and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and Silvia Costantini and S Crucy and Sven Dildick and Guillaume Garcia and Benjamin Klein and Jeremie Lellouch and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Dirk Ryckbosch and S Salva Diblen and Michael Sigamani and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and S Walsh and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and G Bruno and R Castello and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and T du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and P Jez and M Komm and V Lemaitre and J Liao and O Militaru and C Nuttens and D Pagano and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and JM Vizan Garcia and N Beliy and T Caebergs and E Daubie and GH Hammad and GA Alves and M Correa Martins Junior and T Martins and ME Pol and WL Aldá Júnior and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custódio and EM Da Costa and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and H Malbouisson and M Malek and D Matos Figueiredo and L Mundim and H Nogima and WL Prado Da Silva|Year|2014|Publisher|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Citedby|743|Eprint|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-2980-6', '|Title|Isolation of human multipotent mesenchymal stem cells from second?trimester amniotic fluid using a novel two?stage culture protocol|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to isolate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from amniotic fluid obtained by second?trimester amniocentesis. METHODS: A novel two?stage culture protocol for culturing MSCs was developed. Flow cytometry, RT–PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to analyse the phenotypic characteristics of the cultured MSCs. Von Kossa, Oil Red O and TuJ?1 stainings were used to assess the differentiation potentials of MSCs. RESULTS: Amniotic fluid?derived MSCs (AFMSCs) were successfully isolated, cultured and enriched without interfering with the routine process of fetal karyotyping. Flow cytometry analyses showed that they were positive for SH2, SH3, SH4, CD29, CD44 and HLA?ABC (MHC class I), low positive for CD90 and CD105, but negative for CD10, CD11b, CD14, CD34, CD117, HLA?DR, DP, DQ (MHC class II) and EMA.

The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or a Z boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes H? ZZ, WW, ??, ??, bb, and ??. All results are reported assuming a value of 125. 09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb? 1 at s= 7 s= 7 TeV and 20 fb? 1 at s= 8 s= 8 TeV.

The last possibility is particularly challenging because the systems must accommodate not only bending but also stretching. Although several approaches are available for the electronics, a persistent difficulty is in power supplies that have similar mechanical properties, to allow their co-integration with the electronics. Here we introduce a set of materials and design concepts for a rechargeable lithium ion battery technology that exploits thin, low modulus silicone elastomers as substrates, with a segmented design in the active materials, and unusual ‘self-similar’interconnect structures between them. The result enables reversible levels of stretchability up to 300%, while maintaining …</div></div></div>|Author|Sheng Xu and Yihui Zhang and Jiung Cho and Juhwan Lee and Xian Huang and Lin Jia and Jonathan A Fan and Yewang Su and Jessica Su and Huigang Zhang and Huanyu Cheng and Bingwei Lu and Cunjiang Yu and Chi Chuang and Tae-il Kim and Taeseup Song and Kazuyo Shigeta and Sen Kang and Canan Dagdeviren and Ivan Petrov and Paul V Braun and Yonggang Huang and Ungyu Paik and John A Rogers|Year|2013|Publisher|Nature Publishing Group|Citedby|684|Eprint|https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2553', '|Title|Jet production rates in association with W and Z bosons in pp collisions at |Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">A bstract Measurements of jet production rates in association with W and Z bosons for jet transverse momenta above 30 GeV are reported, using a sample of proton-proton collision events recorded by CMS at s=7TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb? 1. The study includes the measurement of the normalized inclusive rates of jets ? (V+? n jets)/? (V), where V represents either a W or a Z. In addition, the ratio of W to Z cross sections and the W charge asymmetry as a function of the number of associated jets are measured. A test of scaling at s=7TeV is also presented. The measurements provide a stringent test of perturbative-QCD calculations and are sensitive to the possible presence of new physics. The results are in agreement with the predictions of a simulation that uses explicit matrix element calculations for final states with jets.</div></div>|Author|Serguei Chatrchyan and Vardan

In humans, activation of Toll-like receptor 2/1 (TLR2/1) on monocytes induces a vitamin D dependent antimicrobial activity against intracellular mycobacteria. Here, we report that TLR activation of monocytes triggers induction of the defensin beta 4 gene (DEFB4), requiring convergence of the IL-1? and vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathways. TLR2/1 activation triggered IL-1? activity, involving the upregulation of both IL-1? and IL-1 receptor, and downregulation of the IL-1 receptor antagonist. TLR2/1L induction of IL-1? was required for upregulation of DEFB4, but not cathelicidin, whereas VDR activation was required for expression of both antimicrobial genes. The differential requirements for induction of DEFB4 and cathelicidin were reflected by differences in their respective promoter regions; the DEFB4 promoter had one vitamin D response element (VDRE) and two NF-?B sites, whereas the cathelicidin promoter had three VDREs and no NF-?B sites. Transfection of NF-?B into primary monocytes synergized with 1,25D3 in the induction of DEFB4 expression. Knockdown of either DEFB4 or cathelicidin in primary monocytes resulted in the loss of TLR2/1-mediated antimicrobial activity against intracellular mycobacteria. Therefore, these data identify a novel mechanism of host defense requiring the induction of IL-1? in synergy with vitamin D activation, for the TLR-induced antimicrobial pathway against an intracellular pathogen.</div></div>|Author|Philip T Liu and Mirjam Schenk and Valencia P Walker and Paul W Dempsey and Melissa Kanchanapoomi and Matthew Wheelwright and Aria Vazirnia and Xiaoran Zhang and Andreas Steinmeyer and Ulrich Zügel and Bruce W Hollis and Genhong Cheng and Robert L Modlin|Year|2009|Publisher|Public Library of Science|Citedby|257|Eprint|https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005810', '|Title|All-trans retinoic acid shifts Propionibacterium acnes-induced matrix degradation expression profile toward matrix preservation in human monocytes|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div><div class=""gsh_csp""><i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> is a critical component in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, stimulating the production of various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, important in the local inflammatory response found in acne.

Supplementation of FCS with the vitamin D prohormone (25D3) rescues TLR-induction of cathelicidin but not DEFB4. Induction of DEFB4 in HS is dependent on the VDR, but the active vitamin D (1,25D3) alone was not sufficient for DEFB4 expression, suggesting another factor is required, such as IL-1?.

Until now the EC network of national fish disease laboratories have focused mainly on diseases of salmonids. With the inclusion of Eastern European countries, and more intensive and extensive pond culture of carp and other fish species, we can expect an increase in the proportion of disease problems occurring especially in cyprinids on both sides of the accession line. As a preparation for the necessary carp disease diagnosis, the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for Fish Diseases and the UK National Reference Laboratory (NRL) CEFAS in Weymouth organised a workshop on diseases of carp attended by all of the EC NRL’s for Fish Diseases in June 2003. One of the topics of major concern at the workshop was Koi Herpesvirus (KHV).</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">KHV causes severe disease and mortalities in all ages of common carp and koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) and is spreading rapidly across the globe.

Japan experienced its first outbreak of KHV in May 2003, followed by extensive outbreaks of KHV in cage-cultured carp in October 2003.

Thirty to forty years ago, studies of viruses in reptiles focused mainly on the zoonotic potential of arboviruses in reptiles and much effort went into surveys and challenge trials of a range of reptiles with eastern and western equine encephalitis as well as Japanese encephalitis viruses. In the past decade, outbreaks of infection with West Nile virus in human populations and in farmed alligators in the USA has seen the research emphasis placed on the issue of reptiles, particularly crocodiles and alligators, being susceptible to, and reservoirs for, this serious zoonotic disease. Although there are many recognised reptilian viruses, the evidence for those being primary pathogens is relatively limited. Transmission studies establishing pathogenicity and cofactors are likewise scarce, possibly due to the relatively low commercial importance of reptiles, difficulties with the availability of animals and permits for statistically sound experiments, difficulties with housing of reptiles in an experimental setting or the inability to propagate some viruses in cell culture to sufficient titres for transmission studies. Viruses as causes of direct loss of threatened species, such as the chelonid fibropapilloma associated herpesvirus and ranaviruses in farmed and wild tortoises and turtles, have re-focused attention back to the characterisation of the viruses as well as diagnosis and pathogenesis in the host itself.</div></div>|Author|Ellen Ariel|Year|2011|Publisher|BioMed Central|Citedby|56|Eprint|https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1297-9716-42-100', '|Title|Finfish in aquaculture and their diseases-A retrospective view on the European Community|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Results from annual surveys since 1995, in the European Union (EU) and some neighbouring states on the epidemiological situation of fish diseases listed in Council Directive 91/67/EEC Annex A, and on other emerging fish diseases, forms the basis of this paper. The production of cultured finfish is expanding in EU. From 1995 to 2000 total aquaculture production increased 60% to approximately 520 000 tonnes in 2000. The traditional emphasis on rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) and salmon (Salmo salar) production shifted during those years to include other species–of particular mention are seabream (Sparus aurata) and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the rapidly growing Mediterranean aquaculture industry. ISA entered the Community in 1998, but appears to have departed again after prompt implementation of control measures given in Council Directive 93/53/EEC, thus regaining its status as an exotic disease in EU. The ongoing efforts of surveillance for notifiable fish diseases on list II, and the associated ensuing trade regulations between approved and non-approved zones have in most cases successfully contained those diseases.

Pooled samples of internal organs (kidney, liver and heart or brain) from 2621 lampreys were examined for the presence of VHSV by standard virological techniques. VHSV was isolated from 5 samples from the rivers Lestijoki and Kalajoki, which flow from Finland into the Bothnian Bay of the Baltic Sea. The presence of VHSV was confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT), ELISA and RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length VHSV glycoprotein (G) gene sequence revealed that the isolates were most closely related to the VHSV strain isolated in 1996 from herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus in the Eastern Gotland Basin of the Baltic Sea, and were therefore assigned to VHSV genotype II. The partial G gene sequences obtained (nt 1 to 672–1129) of all 5 lamprey VHSV isolates were identical, and so were the entire G genes (nt 1 to 1524) of 2 isolates sequenced.

Due to the largely unregulated nature of this trade, it presents considerable potential for transboundary transfer of disease agents. Although tropical ornamental fish are usually kept in indoor aquaria and are unlikely to survive for long if released into the environment of temperate regions, they are capable of carrying viruses that pose a threat to temperate fish species. Of particular concern are ranaviruses, which have been reported in several tropical ornamental fish. Some of these ranaviruses are highly pathogenic to certain temperate fish species, both farmed and wild. The so-called ‘cold-water ornamentals’ are fancy varieties of common species, mostly cyprinids, which do survive and breed in temperate waters, as well as in tropical countries. The most widely traded of these species internationally are goldfish (Carassius auratus) and koi carp (Cyprinus carpio koi) and both species have been implicated in trans-boundary transfer of viral diseases. Most recently, koi herpes, which is capable of causing large-scale mortalities not only in koi carp, but also in common carp varieties farmed for consumption, has been spread to several countries via this trade. The ornamental fish trade is also suspected in the first introduction of the OIE notifiable disease: spring viraemia of carp (SVC) to the USA. Such events are likely to lead to increased demands for health certification for ornamental fish, which may in the short term cause restrictions on the trade; however, in the long term it is likely to aid the sustained development of the ornamental fish industry.</div></div></div>|Author|Ellen Ariel|Year|1970|Publisher|Fish Health Section, Asian Fisheries Society, Manila, Philippines Queensland, Australia|Citedby|13|Eprint|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ellen_Ariel/publication/267703637_Ornamental_Fish_as_Trans-Boundary_Vectors_of_Viral_Diseases/links/55c6f9fb08aebc967df53b70/Ornamental-Fish-as-Trans-Boundary-Vectors-of-Viral-Diseases.pdf', '|Title|Concurrent gout and suspected hypovitaminosis A in crocodile hatchlings|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">P</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">, roblems of parasites, bacterial septicaemia and fungal infections in crocodile hatchlings on farms have been reduced in recent years.

The ubiquitous nature of the term, however, contributes to its elusiveness and to the difficulty in distinguishing it from such related terms as information, channel, and media and from the myriad of organizational concepts that incorporate nuances of the term. Classical organizational theorists have equated communication with written documents and the authority to give commands (Weber 1947), the upward flow of messages and the persuasion of workers (Taylor 1947), the horizontal flow of information (Fayol 1949), listening and informal communication (Roethlisberger 1941), feedback and circular behavior (Follett 1941), decision premises (Simon 1957), and formal channels of communication (Barnard 1968). Contemporary organizational theorists treat communication as synonymous with such constructs as information processing (Galbraith 1973), social networks (Rogers and Kincaid 1981; Tichy and Fombrun 1979), coordination (Hage 1974), and participation (Likert 1967; Miller and Monge 1986).

Our framework grows out of the observation that power and discourse are mutually constitutive: at any particular moment in time, discourses-structured collections of texts and associated practices of textual production, transmission and consumptionshape the system of power that exists in a particular context by holding in place the categories and identities upon which it rests. In other words, the distribution of power among actors, the forms of power on which actors can draw, and the types of actor that may exercise power in a given situation are constituted by discourse and are, at a particular moment, fixed. Over time, however, discourses evolve as this system of power privileges certain actors, enabling them to construct and disseminate texts. Depending on the dynamics of transmission and consumption, these texts may influence the broader discourse and shape the discursive context. Thus, the power dynamics that characterize a particular context determine, at least partially, how and why certain actors are able to influence the processes of textual production and consumption that result in new texts that transform, modify or reinforce discourses. In other words, discourse shapes relations of power while relations of power shape who influences discourse over time and in what way. In order to understand the relationship between power and discourse, we need to unpack this complex, mutually constitutive relationship.

They also include democratic governance structures which allow members of the community or constituency they serve to participate in the management of the organisation.

The EPPE team collected a wide range of information on 3,000 children who were recruited at age 3+ and studied longitudinally until the end of Key Stage 1. Data were collected on children’s developmental profiles (at ages 3, 4/5, 6 and 7 years), background characteristics related to their parents, the child’s home learning environment, and the pre-school settings children attended. Settings (141) were drawn from a range of providers (local authority day nurseries, integrated 1 centres, playgroups, private day nurseries, nursery schools and nursery classes). A sample of ‘home’children,(who had no or minimal pre-school experience) were recruited to the study at entry to school for comparison with the pre-school group.

In the interests of clarity and ease of presentation the main body of the report begins with detail of the methodology that was employed in the study and by a critical review of the literature with an account of the questions that were addressed. This is followed by an extended discussion and analysis of our findings. It should be understood that a good deal of the literature review, and the elaboration of our research questions and arguments were constructed in the process of our data collection and analysis.

The associated Researching Effective Pedagogy in the Early Years (REPEY, Siraj-Blatchford et al DfES Research Report 356) project enabled the addition of two reception classes to the 12 EPPE cases (ie 14 case study centres in total), and this additional data is included in Technical Paper 10. The aim of the intensive case study analyses has been to tease out the specific pedagogical and other practices that are associated with achieving\'excellent\'outcomes compared to those centres with\'good\'or more\'average\'outcomes. The EPPE definition of\'effectiveness\' is based on child outcomes, which was understood as a necessary but insufficient component of quality on its own. High quality provision is related to child outcomes but also to the quality of child care and pedagogical practices that is offered as well. The report shows how the actual practices in the settings vary in important ways. The findings show that good outcomes for children are linked to early years settings that: View cognitive and social development of children as complementary and do not prioritise one over the other. Have strong leadership and long-serving staff (three years plus, this was even the case in the private daycare settings where the turnover of staff is normally the highest).

Almost all current programs for this task create or use explicit, abstract generalizations. These programs are largely ineffective for domains with weak or intractable theories. An exemplar-based approach is suitable for domains with inadequate theories but raises two additional problems: determining similarity and indexing exemplars. Our approach extends the exemplar-based approach with solutions to these problems. An implementation of our approach, called Protos, has been applied to the domain of clinical audiology. After reasonable training, Protos achieved a competence level equaling that of human experts and far surpassing that of other machine learning programs. Additionally, an “ablation study” has identified the aspects of Protos that are primarily responsible for its success.</div></div></div></div></div>|Author|Bruce W Porter and Ray Bareiss and Robert C Holte|Year|1990|Publisher|Elsevier|Citedby|395|Eprint|https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a248064.pdf', '|Title|Exemplar-based knowledge acquisition: A unified approach to concept representation, classification, and learning|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Exemplar-Based Knowledge Acquisition: A Unified Approach to Concept Representation, Classification, and Learning covers the fundamental issues in cognitive science and the technology for solving real problems.

However, to be effectively remembered, a story must be told in a context that enables the hearer to index it functionally in memory. This occurs naturally when stories are told to students while they are attempting to perform the task being taught. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to engage students in a task while teaching it, so some other context must be found that facilitates appropriate indexing. We argue that this context occurs naturally in a teaching dialog, called an Aesopic dialog, in which the student asks questions and the expert answers with stories. In this dialog, the coherence of the conversation itself provides a context that enables the stories to be usefully incorporated into the student\'s memory. The widespread application of teaching through Aesopic dialogs requires overcoming the hurdle that experts are scarce and …</div></div></div>|Author|William Ferguson and Ray Bareiss and Lawrence Birnbaum and Richard Osgood|Year|1992|Publisher|Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|Citedby|179|Eprint|', '|Title|Exemplar-based knowledge acquisition|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Classification is fundamental to intelligent problem solving. By classifying a new entity, a problem solver can avoid much of the effort required for processing a unique occurrence. The problem solver\'s experience with similar entities could be brought to bear, and its limited computational resources conserved. Classification is the process of recognizing an entity as an instance of a known concept. A concept is the intensional representation of a class of entities that are equivalent with respect to the problem solver\'s goals and experience. An entity is classified by recognizing that its attributes imply that it is an instance of a particular concept strongly than they imply that it is an instance of any contrasting concept. To classify reliably, the problem solver must have an accurate representation of the correspondences between attributes and concepts.

Ideally, students would learn from stories told in the natural course of conversations with experts in the domain of interest. Unfortunately, experts are scarce, so such direct access is limited. Our solution to this problem is to broaden access to expert stories through the development of hypermedia systems designed to provide an interaction that emulates, as much as possible, the cognitively relevant aspects of a conversation with an expert. We have constructed a number of such storybased teachers, called ASK systems, in domains as diverse as trust bank consulting, Presidential decision-making, and the historical causes of the success of a nation\'s industries in the global market. In this paper we identify and discuss three primary factors influencing the design of the indexing networks which lie at the heart of these systems: the task being taught, the learning goals of the student, and the source and nature of the stories.</div></div></div>|Author|William Ferguson and Ray Bareiss and Richard Osgood and Lawrence Birnbaum|Year|1991|Publisher|Evanston, IL|Citedby|9|Eprint|', '|Title|A wizard of oz tool for android|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Although mobile-based prototyping platforms are numerous, there are currently no tools that support Wizard of Oz interactions on Android.

Fifty seven cats were removed between June 2009 and April 2010 and our model estimated that there was a 95% chance that a further 1 to 4 cats remained, with 1 cat being the most likely number.

Yet epidemiological theory for metapopulations has largely overlooked the capacity of particular patches to act as refuges from disease, and has suggested that connectivity can undermine persistence. Here, we show that relatively warm and saline wetlands are environmental refuges from chytridiomycosis for an endangered Australian frog, and act jointly with connectivity to sustain frog metapopulations. We coupled models of microclimate and infection probability to map chytrid prevalence, and demonstrate a strong negative relationship between chytrid prevalence and the persistence of frog populations.

Detection probability was defined as the per-individual, per-trap, per-night probability of a possum being captured, and was modelled as a function of home-range utilisation.

This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2–like 1 (BCL-X L), which has shown clinical efficacy in some BCL-2–dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X L inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2–selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2–dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in …</div></div></div>|Author|Andrew J Souers and Joel D Leverson and Erwin R Boghaert and Scott L Ackler and Nathaniel D Catron and Jun Chen and Brian D Dayton and Hong Ding and Sari H Enschede and Wayne J Fairbrother and David CS Huang and Sarah G Hymowitz and Sha Jin and Seong Lin Khaw and Peter J Kovar and Lloyd T Lam and Jackie Lee and Heather L Maecker and Kennan C Marsh and Kylie D Mason and Michael J Mitten and Paul M Nimmer and Anatol Oleksijew and Chang H Park and Cheol-Min Park and Darren C Phillips and Andrew W Roberts and Deepak Sampath and John F Seymour and Morey L Smith and Gerard M Sullivan and Stephen K Tahir and Chris Tse and Michael D Wendt and Yu Xiao and John C Xue and Haichao Zhang and Rod A Humerickhouse and Saul H Rosenberg and Steven W Elmore|Year|2013|Publisher|Nature Publishing Group|Citedby|1374|Eprint|', '|Title|Comparative genomics of the lactic acid bacteria|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Lactic acid-producing bacteria are associated with various plant and animal niches and play a key role in the production of fermented foods and beverages. We report nine genome sequences representing the phylogenetic and functional diversity of these bacteria. The small genomes of lactic acid bacteria encode a broad repertoire of transporters for efficient carbon and nitrogen acquisition from the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit and reflect a limited range of biosynthetic capabilities that indicate both prototrophic and auxotrophic strains. Phylogenetic analyses, comparison of gene content across the group, and reconstruction of ancestral gene sets indicate a combination of extensive gene loss and key gene acquisitions via horizontal gene transfer during the coevolution of lactic acid bacteria with their habitats.</div></div></div>|Author|K Makarova and A Slesarev and Y Wolf and A Sorokin and B Mirkin and E Koonin and A Pavlov and N Pavlova and V Karamychev and N Polouchine and V Shakhova and I Grigoriev and Y Lou and D Rohksar and S Lucas and K Huang and DM Goodstein and T Hawkins and V Plengvidhya and D Welker and J Hughes and Y Goh and A Benson and K Baldwin and J-H Lee and I Diaz-Muniz and B Dosti and V Smeianov and W Wechter and R Barabote and G Lorca and E Altermann and R Barrangou and B Ganesan and Y Xie and H Rawsthorne and D Tamir and C Parker and F Breidt and J Broadbent and R Hutkins and D O\'sullivan and J Steele and G Unlu and M Saier and T Klaenhammer and P Richardson and S Kozyavkin and B Weimer and D Mills|Year|2006|Publisher|National Academy of Sciences|Citedby|1180|Eprint|https://www.pnas.org/content/103/42/15611', '|Title|Meta-analysis identifies 29 additional ulcerative colitis risk loci, increasing the number of confirmed associations to 47|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies in ulcerative colitis have identified 18 susceptibility loci. We conducted a meta-analysis of six ulcerative colitis genome-wide association study datasets, comprising 6,687 cases and 19,718 controls, and followed up the top association signals in 9,628 cases and 12,917 controls. We identified 29 additional risk loci (P&lt; 5× 10? 8), increasing the number of ulcerative colitis–associated loci to 47. After annotating associated regions using GRAIL, expression quantitative trait loci data and correlations with non-synonymous SNPs, we identified many candidate genes that provide potentially important insights into disease pathogenesis, including IL1R2, IL8RA-IL8RB, IL7R, IL12B, DAP, PRDM1, JAK2, IRF5, GNA12 and LSP1.

Recent substantive applications include Hamilton (1988)(interest rates), Hamilton (1989)(aggregate output), Cecchetti, Lam and Mark (1990) and Abel (1992)(stock returns), and Engel and Hamilton (1990)(exchange rates), among many others. Our attention here focuses on Hamilton\'s Markov switching model, which has become very popular. In Hamilton\'s model, time-series dynamics are governed by a finite-dimensional parameter vector, which switches (potentially each period) depending upon which of two states is realised, with state transitions governed by a first-order Markov process with constant transition probabilities. Although the popularity of Hamilton\'s model is well deserved, it nevertheless incorporates a potentially severely binding constraint, the constancy of state transition probabilities. Economic considerations suggest the desirability of allowing the transition probabilities to vary. As an example, consider the process of exchange rate revaluation. It is plausible that the likelihood of exchange rate revaluation increases under progressively more severe over-or undervaluation on the basis of economic fundamentals, and certainly, one would not want to exclude that possibility from the outset.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">\'Financial support from the UK Economic and Social Research Council under grant R000233447 is gratefully acknowledged by both authors.

Data are collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The distribution of transverse momentum (p T) surrounding dijet systems is measured by selecting charged particles in different ranges of p T and at different angular cones of pseudorapidity and azimuth. The measurement is performed as a function of centrality of the PbPb collisions, the p T asymmetry of the jets in the dijet pair, and the distance parameter R used in the anti-k T jet clustering algorithm. In events with unbalanced dijets, PbPb collisions show an enhanced multiplicity in the hemisphere of the subleading jet, with the p T imbalance compensated by an excess of low-p T particles at large angles from the jet axes.</div></div>|Author|Vardan Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and W Adam and E Asilar and T Bergauer and J Brandstetter and E Brondolin and M Dragicevic and J Erö and M Flechl and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and C Hartl and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and V Knünz and A König and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and T Matsushita and I Mikulec and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and H Rohringer and J Schieck and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and W Treberer-Treberspurg and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and S Alderweireldt and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and A Knutsson and J Lauwers and S Luyckx and M Van De Klundert and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and A Van Spilbeeck and S Abu Zeid and F Blekman and J D’Hondt and N Daci and I De Bruyn and K Deroover and N Heracleous and J Keaveney and S Lowette and L Moreels and A Olbrechts and Q Python and D Strom and S Tavernier and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Van Parijs and P Barria and H Brun and C Caillol and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and G Fasanella and L Favart and A Grebenyuk and G Karapostoli and T Lenzi and A Léonard and T Maerschalk and Andrey Marinov and L Perniè and A Randle-Conde and T Seva and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and R Yonamine and F Zenoni and F Zhang and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and S Crucy and Didar Dobur and Alexis Fagot and Guillaume Garcia and Muhammad Gul and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Deniz Poyraz and Dirk Ryckbosch and Sinem Salva and Michael Sigamani and Michael Tytgat and Ward Van Driessche and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and O Bondu and S Brochet and G Bruno and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and A Jafari and P Jez and M Komm and V Lemaitre and A Mertens and M Musich and C Nuttens and L Perrini and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and N Beliy and GH Hammad and WL Aldá Júnior and FL Alves and GA Alves and L Brito and M Correa Martins Junior and M Hamer and C Hensel and C Mora Herrera and A Moraes and ME Pol and P Rebello Teles and E Belchior Batista Das Chagas and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custódio and EM Da Costa|Year|2016|Publisher|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Citedby|463|Eprint|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP01(2016)006', '|Title|Measurement of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections in proton-proton collisions at  = 7 TeV|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">A bstract Measurements of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections are presented using an integrated luminosity of 4.5 (4.8) fb? 1 in the dimuon (dielectron) channel of proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at s= 7 TeV.

In addition, the reliability and validity of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS) was demonstrated.   Methods A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including SAS, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (Y-scale), visual analogue scale (VAS), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of DSM-IV. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26.06; SD = 5.96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of SAS.   Results Based on the factor analysis results, the subscale “disturbance of reality testing” was removed, and six factors were left. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified (Cronbach\'s alpha = 0.967). SAS and its subscales were significantly correlated with K-scale and Y-scale. The VAS of each factor also showed a significant correlation with each subscale. In addition, differences were found in the job (p&lt;0.05), education (p&lt;0.05), and self-reported smartphone addiction scores (p&lt;0.001) in SAS.   Conclusions This study developed the first scale of the smartphone addiction aspect of the diagnostic manual.

The 40S subunit first binds eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 3 and an eIF2–GTP–initiator transfer RNA ternary complex. The resulting complex requires eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4F to bind to a messenger RNA and to scan to the initiation codon 2. eIF5 stimulates hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and eIF2 is released from the 48S complex formed at the initiation codon before it is joined by a 60S subunit to form an active 80S ribosome 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

The authors use a sample of 87 matched dyads from two-party IJVs formed in Kazakhstan to examine the influence of knowledge transfer between IJV partners on commitment and resulting satisfaction.

We argue that the existing trust between organizations not only survives tough and shifting times, but also helps steer those organizations through such trying periods. We investigated a context where a major change was instituted in a cooperative marketing channel. Here, the supplier (the focal channel member) had to convince the other channel members (the retailers) about the impending merger, which may or may not bring benefits to all.

This study develops hypotheses built upon theory to determine how organizational identification impacts the relationship between the evaluation of a firm\'s performance by another firm and key relational variables. This research investigates the impact of the evaluation of exchange performance on key relational and outcome constructs in a variety of different ways. First, the nature of the relationship between the evaluations of performance and outcome variables is assessed for potential curvilinear effects. Second, the incremental effects of the impact of the exchange performance on outcome variables are assessed. Third, this study incorporates responses of the performance of exchange of products and services at the attribute level. Fourth, while studies have incorporated some of the above characteristics, none have incorporated these on the inter-organizational level, the context of the setting here.

Intrusive rocks are inferred to represent the solidified remnants of a plumbing system that fed eruptions at the surface, as well as themselves representing substantial accumulations of magma in the subsurface. The vast majority of intrusive rock within the upper crust is in widespread sills, the emplacement of which may structurally isolate and dismember upper crustal strata from underlying basement, as well as spawning dyke assemblages of complex geometry. Interaction of dykes and shoaling sills with near-surface aquifers is implicated in development of mafic volcaniclastic deposits which, in better-studied provinces, comprise large vent complexes and substantial primary volcaniclastic deposits. Flood lavas generally postdate and overlie mafic volcaniclastic deposits, and are emplaced as pahoehoe flows at a grand scale (up to 104km2) from eruptions lasting years to decades. As with modern Hawaiian analogues, pahoehoe flood lavas have erupted from fissure vents that sometimes show evidence of high lava fountains at times during eruption.

The Zigzag wingbox consists of a rigid part and a morphing part. The rigid part is a semi-monocoque construction that houses the fuel tank and transfers the aerodynamic loads from the morphing part to the fuselage. The morphing part consists of various morphing partitions where in each partition there are two spars each consisting of two beams hinged together. Each morphing partition is covered by flexible skin and is bounded by two ribs through which the spars are connected. The ribs transfer the loads between the spars of adjacent morphing partitions and serves as the main structure to which the flexible skins are to be attached.

Operating under high pressure, hydraulic pistons are capable of producing large, sustainable control forces, but disadvantages include the weight penalty of the bulky actuator components, dense operating fluid, and extensive plumbing.

Human performance over short periods of time was studied to characterize the power available, and the transmission was designed to deliver as much of this power as possible to the rotors. The addition of a hand-cranking mechanism was shown to increase pilot power output by 20% for the intended 60 second duration. The quad-rotor configuration was continued in Gamera II because it was shown to provide passive stability in ground effect. Innovative lightweight structural concepts were developed, which helped reduce vehicle empty weight by 33% to 32.3 kg (71 lb). The rotors were designed using a comprehensive optimization process that coupled aerodynamics, blade spar stiffness, and airframe weight models to yield the lowest possible vehicle power required.

In one sense of the term, argument refers to a verbal dispute in which two or more people maintain what they construe to be incompatible positions regarding an assertion or belief. Moreover, participants mutually attribute argumentative intentions to each other. That is, the parties assume that their assertions are incompatible and that the main goals for each arguer is to win—that is, to arrive at an end state where his or her viewpoint prevails. Thus, winning here means being able to proceed unencumbered in an attempt to maintain a position or to pursue a course of action. The primary plan of attack in this type of argument is to remove any obstacle that stands in the way of one\'s success. If physical force and coercion are necessary, then these serve as appropriate means of goal attainment. If persuasion, either by appeal or by threat, works, then this will be perceived as legitimate. The important point in a disputative argument is that almost any plan that facilitates and supports the desired position will be used. All other goals are subservient to the primary one of winning. A second definition of argument emerges from the study of philosophy, logic, and rhetoric. Here, argument is defined as a form of verbal discourse in which a position, claim, or belief is asserted, and then reasons are given to substantiate this assertion. By substantiation, we mean that an arguer uses reasons as evidence for supporting an assertion and persuading others to accept it. Reasons may be evaluated according to certain criteria, including logical coherence.

In either case, flexibility exists within the system to adapt to changing circumstances, but his distinction centers on who is in charge of that flexibility. For Opperman, an adaptable system is one in which the flexible control of information or system performance automation resides in the hands of the user; s/he must explicitly command, generally at run time, the changes which ensue. In an adaptive system, by contrast, the flexibility in information or automation behavior is controlled by the system. It is as if Opperman is implying (though not explicitly defining) a kind of “metaautomation” which is present and in control of the degrees of freedom and flexibility in information and performance automation subsystems in an adaptive system, but which is absent (and is replaced by human activities) in an adaptable one. It is unclear whether the Augmented Cognition community consistently uses Opperman’s terms or makes his distinction, but it would seem that, in the majority of cases at least, when the phrases “adaptive system”,“adaptive user interface” and “adaptive automation” are used in this community, they are used in Opperman’s sense of a machine system which controls flexibility in information and performance subsystems, albeit in the service of the human.</div><div class=""gsh_csp"">Adaptive systems tend to have some distinct advantages over adaptable ones in terms of their impact on human+ machine system decision making, and these advantages make them useful in a wide range of military and commercial contexts.

We are developing an approach to UAV control that addresses these challenges. We use the metaphor of a sports team’s playbook to enable both quick and complex, variable-initiative control of a variety of UAVs—the user of our Playbook “calls a play” which need not (but may, if the user desires) specify what type or how many UAVs should be used to satisfy it.

This definition emphasizes the nature of trust as an attitude toward the uncertain future actions of an agent. Some important implications of this definition for adaptive automation systems are discussed including (a) trust is not synonymous with user acceptance; in fact, trust should be tuned to result in accurate usage decisions by operators,(b) trust becomes more important with complex, adaptive automation precisely because it becomes less plausible for a human operator to fully understand what and how the automation will operate in all contents, and (c) as an attitude, trust is produced and affected by methods other than rational cognition. In fact, Lee and See provide a model with three methods of tuning trust—analytic, analogic and affective—with special emphasis on their roles trust for adaptive automation. Of these, we argue that the latter two will be more important in human interaction with adaptive automation than they are with traditional automation. We define and discuss a method of tuning analogic and affective trust: the “etiquette” of human interaction with automation.

Caregiver burnout is one of the top reasons for the transition from independent living to costly nursing homes or other care-giving facilities. As a result, technologists are rushing to find tools that can assist caregivers and augment the elder’s ability to age in place. For a generation whose introduction to technology includes the black and white television, where the metaphors of windows and desktops are not automatically understood, the blitz of PDAs, smart homes, and voice recognition systems can be confusing, intimidating and stressful. Add to this the elder’s need for companionship to ward off isolation and dementia, and the design problem transpires to a much bigger challenge than designing around physical limitations of the elderly. The idea of companionship provided by technology is not new. From the simple rule-based Tamagotchi pets to Sony’s sophisticated AIBO, there is a large body of evidence that shows that the owners of these robotic pets form genuine and meaningful emotional bonds. However, few solutions combine ‘purposeful utility’with entertainment and companionship. Solutions that are ‘purposeful’are predictable and seldom achieve the level of autonomy that captures the interest of and engages the user, while solutions with high entertainment value often lack functions that directly aid the elder with daily functions.

To date, such models have been achieved via the scripting of specific trajectories of behaviors or, in limited instances, through very complex,“first principles” psychological models of agent motivation and goal-based behaviors. Neither of these is entirely appropriate for the production of a large series of rich and deep social interactions. We have developed a quantitative, computational implementation of a rich, universal theory of human-human “politeness” behaviors and the culture-specific interpretive frameworks for them (labeled “etiquette”) from sociology, linguistics and anthropology. This model links observable and inferred aspects of power and familiarity relationships, the degree of imposition of an act (each of which have implications for roles and intents) and the actor’s character to produce expectations about politeness behaviors. We have recently demonstrated the ability for this algorithm to produce culture-specific, politeness-appropriate utterances and perceptions of utterances in a game setting. Furthermore, our algorithmic approach to calculating culturespecific attitudes offered distinct advantages over alternate methods of producing such behaviors.

Past theories of mountain climbing, and other adventurous leisure activities, have predominantly focused on uncovering the motives for participation; and risk has been posited as a primary attraction. A number of studies have concluded that identity and meaning are factors related to participation. However, none to date have examined the dynamics by which these factors are constructed and maintained in the lives of participants. This thesis places meaning and self or identity at the centre of its enquiry into how New Zealand mountaineers sustain their commitment to an adventurous leisure activity. Thus, it seeks to address the current lack of knowledge regarding the way in which activities such as mountain climbing can contribute to participants\'  sense of who they are and what their lives are about. A biographical narrative approach was adopted to achieve this central aim as, it is argued, self and meaning are constructed through the stories told about life experiences. Narrative interviews were conducted with twenty-two committed New Zealand mountaineers; and supporting materials were collected from publications and other relevant sources. The interpretation of the research material was facilitated by theories of the interrelationship between narrative, meaning and self, and the implications of current social conditions for their construction. By applying a narrative approach to the study of mountaineers for the first time, this thesis sheds new light on our understanding of mountaineering.

Available approaches for root phenotyping in laboratory, greenhouse and field encompass simple agar plates to labor-intensive root digging (ie, shovelomics) and soil boring methods, the construction of underground root observation stations and sophisticated computer-assisted root imaging.

White clover (<i>Trifolium repens</i>) and red clover (<i>Trifolium pratense</i>) are dominant in specific regions and farm systems. Although breeding progress for disease and insect resistance has been achieved, these crops have shown lower rates of genetic gain for yield than major grain crops, owing to lower breeding investment, longer selection cycles, impossibility to capitalize on harvest index, outbreeding mating systems associated with severe inbreeding depression, and high interaction of genotypes with cropping conditions and crop utilizations.

Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r2 = 0.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum.

The transcriptomes of 27 alfalfa genotypes, including elite breeding genotypes, parents of mapping populations, and unimproved wild genotypes, were sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. De novo assembly of quality-filtered 72-bp reads generated 25,183 contigs with a total length of 26.8 Mbp and an average length of 1,065 bp, with an average read depth of 55.9-fold for each genotype.

Additional markers identified on chromosomes 1 and 8 located the regions where no Verticillium resistance locus has been reported. This study highlights the value of SNP genotyping by high resolution melting to identify the disease resistance loci in tetraploid alfalfa. With further validation, the markers identified in this study could be used for improving resistance to Verticillium wilt in alfalfa breeding programs.</div></div>|Author|Tiejun Zhang and Long-Xi Yu and Per McCord and David Miller and Suresh Bhamidimarri and David Johnson and Maria J Monteros and Julie Ho and Peter Reisen and Deborah A Samac|Year|2014|Publisher|Public Library of Science|Citedby|8|Eprint|https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115953', '|Title|Leaf trait coloration in white clover and molecular mapping of the red midrib and leaflet number traits|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""><div class=""gsh_csp"">White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is a highly outcrossing heterozygous allotetraploid species, for which classic inheritance studies have been inconclusive. With the aid of molecular markers, it is now possible to study the genes controlling morphological traits. The objectives of this study were to catalog the leaf marks in white clover and map the location of leaf morphological traits based on cosegregation with molecular markers. A mapping population segregating for eight morphological traits consisting of leaf marks and number of leaflets was developed and phenotyped at two different locations during the summer and winter seasons. A confirmation population, derived by selfing one of the mapping population parents, was produced and phenotyped in one location at two different times of the year. Through the use of previously published simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker maps, linkages between the mapped …</div></div></div>|Author|Rebecca M Tashiro and Yuanhong Han and María J Monteros and Joseph H Bouton and Wayne A Parrott|Year|2010|Publisher|Crop Science Society of America|Citedby|8|Eprint|https://parrottlab.uga.edu/parrottlab/Publications/Tashiroetal2010.pdf', '|Title|QTL mapping of aluminum tolerance in tetraploid alfalfa|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small""> <div class=""gsh_csp"">Aluminum (Al) toxicity in acid soils is one of the factors limiting crop production.

Al tolerance in alfalfa was identified in a diploid <i>Medicago sativa</i> subs<i>. caerulea</i> accession (Sledge et al., 2002) and has been successfully integrated at the tetraploid level in the Al-tolerant genotype Altet-4. The goals of this study are to identify and confirm quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Al-tolerance in tetraploid alfalfa. Two populations of at least 190 individuals each were developed from crosses between Altet-4 (Al-tolerant) and the Al-susceptible genotypes 95-608 derived from CUF-101, and NECS141, a semi-dormant breeding line developed in Iowa. The parental lines and the progeny from the mapping populations were screened using a callus bioassay and a whole plant assay.

Introduction Alfalfa is one of the most important cultivated forage legumes worldwide. Drought is one of the most important factors limiting yield in crop plants, including alfalfa. Drought tolerance mechanisms are genetically and physiologically complex indicating a quantitative inheritance (Valliyodan et al., 2006). The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with yield under drought stress and to develop and map molecular markers derived from transcription factor genes sequences previously implicated in drought tolerance.</div></div></div>|Author|Ian M Ray and Mary K Sledge and Joseph H Bouton and Maria J Monteros|Year|1970|Publisher||Citedby|5|Eprint|', '|Title|Genetics, genomics and breeding of forage crops|Body|<div class=""gsc_vcd_value"" id=""gsc_vcd_descr""><div class=""gsh_small"">Forage crops include several species of grasses and legumes that are widely used as animal fodder in the form of hay, pasturage and silage, as well as for turf and erosion control.
